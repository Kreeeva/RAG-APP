# README: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Jupyter Notebook implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the **LlamaIndex** library and OpenAI's embedding models. The notebook demonstrates how to build a knowledge-augmented question-answering system by combining retrieval mechanisms with generative AI models.

### Features:
- **Document Ingestion**: Upload and process text documents.
- **Embedding Creation**: Generate vector embeddings for text using OpenAI's embedding models.
- **Indexing**: Create a searchable index using **LlamaIndex**.
- **Question-Answering**: Retrieve relevant documents and generate answers to user queries with a generative AI model.

---

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**
3. Required Python libraries (listed in the `requirements.txt` file):
   - `openai`
   - `llama-index` (formerly known as `gpt-index`)
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas` (for optional data processing)
   - `tqdm` (for progress bars)
   - `dotenv` (for managing API keys)

---

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kreeeva/RAG-APP
   cd retrieval-augmented-generation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the necessary Python libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**:
   - Obtain an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI API dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

4. **Launch the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook file (e.g., `rag_demo.ipynb`) in your browser.

## Notebook Workflow
### 1. **Import Libraries**
   Import all required libraries for document processing, embedding creation, and LlamaIndex.

### 2. **Load Documents**
   - Upload one or more text files or datasets (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf`).
   - Preprocess the documents if necessary.

### 3. **Generate Embeddings**
   Use OpenAI's embedding API to convert text chunks into dense vector representations.

### 4. **Create the Index**
   Build a semantic index of the document embeddings using **LlamaIndex**.

### 5. **Ask Questions**
   Input a natural language question. The system retrieves the most relevant documents from the index and generates an answer using OpenAI's generative language model (e.g., GPT-4).

---

## Example
Here’s how the system works:

1. **Input**: "What are the main benefits of using retrieval-augmented generation?"
2. **Process**:
   - Retrieve relevant context from the indexed documents.
   - Generate a detailed response based on the retrieved data.
3. **Output**: 
   > "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances generative models by grounding their responses in relevant, retrieved documents, leading to more accurate and context-aware answers."

---

## Customization
- **Document Sources**: Extend the ingestion logic to support additional formats like PDFs or scraped web pages.
- **Embedding Model**: Replace OpenAI embeddings with other models, such as Sentence Transformers or Cohere embeddings.
- **Generative Model**: Swap OpenAI's GPT with other LLMs like Anthropic’s Claude or local models like LLaMA.

---

## Limitations
- **API Costs**: Both embedding generation and question-answering use the OpenAI API, which incurs costs.
- **Latency**: Retrieval and generation may have latency depending on document size and the complexity of the query.
- **Document Size**: Large documents might require chunking and batching, which can increase processing time.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for user-provided query corrections.
- Optimize the retrieval pipeline for faster performance with large datasets.
