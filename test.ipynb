Each of them is characterized by a specific risk of losing funds. The highest is in the case of\\nstock trading and its amount is proportional to the possibility of achieving large profits in a short period of time [4].\\nThis factor makes stock trading an important source of income for many investors.\\nThe ability to predict future share prices is important not only for investment decisions, but also when planning a\\ncompany’s development strategy, selecting partners for cooperation, and for financial analysis of the company. Each\\ninvestor makes the decision to buy or sell based on certain information, knowledge or intuition [26]. With different\\nindicators at our disposal [15], it is possible to make more rational decisions. There are many tools on the IT market to\\nsupport making investment decisions. The most commonly used tools are IT systems implementing technical analysis\\nindicators [7], which, based on historical data, present the way in which stock prices are shaped on charts. Along\\nwith the development of statistical models and machine learning, they are used increasingly often in predicting stock\\nprices. In forecasting trends [25], the use of artificial neural networks – a field inspired by biological models – is also\\nbecoming increasingly popular. Time series prediction is a topic that is under constant development and requires a lot\\nof research. Some of the latest research in this field was performed by Mate ´nczuk et al. [21] and Khang et al. [13, 14].\\nThe goal of this paper is to compare two very different models – a statistical one (ARIMA) and a deep learning\\none (LSTM) – using a very broad and representative range of NASDAQ stock exchange data, to find which model\\nperforms better in the problem of time series forecasting. A forecast refers to a calculation or an estimation that uses\\ndata from previous events, combined with recent trends to come up with a future event outcome. On the other hand,\\na prediction is an act of indicating that something will happen in the future with or without prior information [18].\\nTime series are series of numerical data in which each observation is directly related to a given point in time [6]. In\\nthis article, the daily and monthly average stock prices are time series. The field of time series research is in fact about\\ndrawing conclusions based on observations about the parameters of the process that generates the data. It makes it\\npossible to predict future values and a forecast error.\\nTo go through the appropriate comparison of the ARIMA and LSTM models, it was decided to conduct a series\\nof experiments on selected data. Three main goals were taken into consideration. They were to find the best ARIMA\\nmodel, to obtain the best LSTM model and finally to compare the selected models and determine which one is most\\naccurate at predicting stock prices. At the beginning, the focus was on building both models separately, without testing\\nthe parameters. The main goal of this stage was to make the models work properly and not cause errors. The relevant\\nparameters were then tested separately using the ARIMA model and different LSTM architectures. The final stage\\nof the work was to create a program to perform of all the experiments and automatically save the results based on\\nthe created convention. An important step was also to select the appropriate accuracy measures, thanks to which\\nit was possible to correctly compare the results of the built models. Each step was implemented using the Python\\nprogramming language.\\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the research methodology. Section 3 discusses\\nthe significance and relevance of the results. Section 4 concludes the results and briefly specifies the future work\\ndirections.\\n2. Methodology\\n2.1. Input Data\\nFor the purposes of the analysis and modeling, nine of the most popular NASDAQ sectors, namely: IT, automotive,\\nfinancial, logistics & transport, clothing, food, energy, healthcare, and entertainment & media, were selected. In the\\nadopted methodology, inspiration was taken from the approach used by [23]. Each sector includes the share prices of\\n10 companies. Particular attention was paid to the fact that the training model should cover stock prices from various\\nsectors to avoid overfitting.\\nIn the technology sector, very large enterprises have been selected that operate globally and have a real impact on\\nthe fluctuations of trends in technology. The list includes both companies related to the production of software and the\\nproduction of computer hardware. A social network was also selected for this sector (See Table1).\\nIn the automotive sector, it was also decided to select companies that represent a cross-section of the situation on the\\nmarket. Companies with a long tradition have been added to companies with modern electric technologies.

After looking at other\\n4 D. Kobiela et al./ Procedia Computer Science 00 (2022) 000–000\\nscientific literature about stock prices [32, 34], it was noticed that although the closing price is used in a lot of articles,\\nthe average price is technically acceptable as well. For technical reasons, especially in the neural network model, the\\ndaily average price is better than the daily closing price, because it helps to reduce the noise in the data. It is more\\nresistant to outliers, which may happen at the end of the day. Thus, the average price was chosen rather than the\\nclosing price. It was also decided to perform experiments with two types of data (daily and monthly).\\n2.2. Computational Models\\n2.2.1. ARIMA model\\nThe basic model in the time series analysis is the ARIMA model. It is a combination of two processes – autoregres-\\nsive (AR) and moving average (MA), which is weighted delayed random components. The letter I in the model name\\nindicates the level of integration of the analyzed variable. Integrated variables are variables that can become stationary\\nthrough differentiation. The structure of ARIMA is based on the phenomenon of autocorrelation. ARIMA can be used\\nfor modeling stationary time series or non-stationary time series that can become stationary through differentiation.\\nStationary series are those whose expected value and variance do not change over time, the series values themselves\\ndo not deviate from the initial values, and the value of the covariance for two observations depends on the spacing\\nbetween them, not the timing of their origin. The universal notationARIMA (p, d, q) is used to describe the form\\nof the ARIMA model. The letter p is the order of the regression, d is the order of di fferentiation and q is the order\\nof the moving average. The process of building the ARIMA model can be divided into three phases, which follows\\nthe Box-Jenkins method. In the first phase, identification, the characteristics of the analyzed time series are checked.\\nA decision is made about the need for data to transform and differentiate the series to stabilize its mean, variance\\ncovariance. This is done by both examining the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF),\\nand by performing statistical Dickey-Fuller and Augmented-Dickey-Fuller tests. In the second phase, estimation and\\ntests, the parameters of the selected models are estimated. The final model selection is usually based on the analysis of\\nseveral criteria – the significance of model parameters, error metric and information criterion (Akaike’s Information\\nCriterion, Bayesian Information Criterion). The next step is a diagnostic check. The properties of a number of model\\nresiduals are analyzed. If the residuals of the model are a white noise process, and there are no significant ACF or\\nPACF values of a series of model residuals, the model can be used for forecasting. Otherwise, the estimation and test-\\ning phases should be repeated, and a different model should be selected. In some cases, it may be necessary to return\\nto the identification phase. In the third phase, the model is used to prepare a forecast ([20]). The forecast is performed\\nusing in-sample and out-of-sample periods. The given dataset is split into an in-sample period, used for the initial\\nparameter estimation and model selection, and an out-of-sample period, used to evaluate the forecasting performance.\\nEmpirical evidence based on the out-of-sample forecast performance is generally considered more trustworthy than\\nevidence based on the in-sample performance, which can be more sensitive to outliers [8].\\nTo obtain the desired level of stationarity of the series, all of the input data was logarithmized.\\n2.2.2. LSTM model\\nA historic scientific paper published in 1943 [22] initiated a new field of research called artificial neural networks\\n(ANNs). The mathematicians presented an artificial neuron – a model of a nerve cell – and linked its operation to\\ndata processing. Since then, the field has been constantly evolving. Hebb discovered in 1949 [11] that information can\\nbe stored in the structure of connections between neurons and proposed a new method of learning ANN consisting\\nin changing the connection weights between neurons. The word “Perceptron” was proposed by Rosenblatt [28], who\\ntogether with Wightman built a neural-like network. It was part electronic, part electromechanical and was used to rec-\\nognize alphanumeric characters. It was the first physical and functional machine of this type. The above achievement\\nled to the spread of interest in neural networks and research on them all over the world.\\nRecursive neural networks (RNNs) are a broad class of networks in which, even as the input data changes over\\ntime, the same parameters are used. Recursive networks are among the most successful models that are devouring\\napplications both in research and industry to problems related to sequential data in natural language processing, time\\nseries prediction and classification. The main differences between unidirectional and recursive networks are that RNNs\\nsee the time data in an ordered form as values in successive steps and have a state that is preserved between successive\\ntime steps. It is this state, as well as its static parameters, that are responsible for updating the network response after\\nproviding it with new information in the next steps. The disadvantage of RNNs is that they suffer from short-term', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='10eb1b86-7fe7-4aa5-8622-92e4cc01992d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3834', 'file_name': '26thInternationalConferenceonKnowledge-BasedandIntelligentInformation&Engineering.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\26thInternationalConferenceonKnowledge-BasedandIntelligentInformation&Engineering.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 839331, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-02'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='3834 Dariusz Kobiela  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 207 (2022) 3830–3839\\nD.

The next experiments were therefore carried out\\nusing these parameters. A comparison of the GRU and LSTM architectures was also performed, which showed that\\nin the case of the selected data, the GRU architecture performs worse than the LSTM.\\nThe experiments performed to choose time windows for LSTM showed that the best input window sizes for LSTM\\nare 180 days in the case of daily intervals and averaged 1800 days in the case of monthly intervals.\\nFig. 5. Validation loss values for different input window sizes\\nThe further conducted research showed that in most cases, ARIMA performs better than LSTM (according to the\\ncomparison of the MAPE error values). When predicting 30 days, ARIMA is about 3.4 times better than LSTM. In\\nthe case of predicting averaged 1 month, ARIMA performed about 1.6 times better than LSTM. When predicting\\naveraged 3 months, ARIMA is about 1.8 times better than LSTM. When predicting averaged 9 months, ARIMA is\\nabout 2.1 times better than LSTM. LSTM only performed better in the case of 1-day prediction (about 1.12 times\\nbetter). It can therefore be concluded that the longer the period, the better ARIMA performs and the worse LSTM\\nperforms (the ARIMA results confirm the results obtained by Wang et al. [31]). Based just on the price feature, the\\nARIMA model is better at calculating the next predictions. The achieved results confirm the results found by Yi-Tou\\net al. [2]. A comparison of the achieved MAPE results for ARIMA and LSTM for different time windows is shown in\\nTable5.\\nLearning plots showed that LSTM is not learning (after the 5th epoch, an example is shown in Figure5). The\\nreason of this behavior is that not enough features were taken into account (just one feature was used – price). In\\nLSTM, all of the desired prediction period values are predicted at once. That is why LSTM produces worse results–\\nit consists of a more complicated architecture which needs more features for effective training. Otherwise, the LSTM\\nmodel is in its basic state and is not using its full potential. The colors used are not important in Figure5 and only\\nserve to make it easier to distinguish between different time windows. In the case of predicting the stock prices of\\nNASDAQ-listed companies using just historical price values (single feature), the statistical model (ARIMA) achieves\\nbetter results than the deep learning model (LSTM).\\nA comparison of the ARIMA and LSTM sample prediction results for the 30-day prediction periods for the IBM\\ncompany are shown in Figures2, 3 and 4. Colors used: blue indicates historical company prices (used by the models\\neither to learn in the case of LSTM or as the in-sample period in the case of ARIMA); red indicates the forecast\\nperformed by the model; green indicates the company’s real future prices (used to calculate the error between the\\nforecast and the actual values).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='20cec619-ad8f-4ebf-82d5-07d5fec3a9b0', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3838', 'file_name': '26thInternationalConferenceonKnowledge-BasedandIntelligentInformation&Engineering.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\26thInternationalConferenceonKnowledge-BasedandIntelligentInformation&Engineering.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 839331, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-02'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='3838 Dariusz Kobiela  et al. / Procedia Computer Science 207 (2022) 3830–3839\\nD.

It is not an \\nacademic treatise on fi  nancial theory. Rather, I hope to make accessible to \\nthe reader some of the most useful fi  nancial research done in the past few \\ndecades, mixing them with insights I gained from actually exploiting some \\nof those theories in live trading.\\nBecause strategies take a central place in this book, we will cover a wide \\narray of them, broadly divided into the mean-reverting and momentum \\ncamps, and we will lay out standard techniques for trading each category of \\nstrategies, and equally important, the fundamental reasons why a strategy \\nshould work. The emphasis throughout is on simple and linear strategies, \\nas an antidote to the overfi  tting and data-snooping biases that often plague \\ncomplex strategies.\\nIn the mean-reverting camp, we will discuss the multiple statistical tech-\\nniques (augmented Dickey-Fuller [ADF] test, Hurst exponent, Variance Ra-\\ntio test, half-life) for detecting “time series” mean reversion or stationarity, \\nand for detecting cointegration of a portfolio of instruments (cointegrated \\naugmented Dickey Fuller [CADF] test, Johansen test). Beyond the mechani-\\ncal application of these statistical tests to time series, we strive to convey an \\nintuitive understanding of what they are really testing and the simple math-\\nematical equations behind them. \\nW e will explain the simplest techniques and strategies for trading mean-\\nreverting portfolios (linear, Bollinger band, Kalman fi  lter), and whether us-\\ning raw prices, log prices, or ratios make the most sense as inputs to these \\ntests and strategies.

Distinction between \\ntime series versus cross-sectional mean reversion will be made. W e will de-\\nbate the pros and cons of “scaling-in” and highlight the danger of data errors \\nin mean-reverting strategies, especially those that deal with spreads. \\nExamples of mean-reverting strategies will be drawn from interday and \\nintraday stocks models, exchange-traded fund (ETF) pairs and triplets, \\nETFs versus their component stocks, currency pairs, and futures calen-\\ndar and intermarket spreads. W e will explain what makes trading some of \\nthese strategies quite challenging in recent years due to the rise of dark \\npools and high-frequency trading. W e will also illustrate how certain fun-\\ndamental considerations can explain the temporary unhinging of a hitherto \\nvery profi  table ETF pair and how the same considerations can lead one to \\nconstruct an improved version of the strategy. When discussing currency \\ntrading, we take care to explain why even the calculation of returns may \\nseem foreign to an equity trader, and where such concepts as rollover inter-\\nest may sometimes be important. Much emphasis will be devoted to the \\nstudy of spot returns versus roll returns in futures, and several futures trad-\\ning strategies can be derived or understood from a simple mathematical \\nmodel of futures prices. The concepts of backwardation and contango will \\nbe illustrated graphically as well as mathematically. The chapter on mean \\nreversion of currencies and futures cumulates in the study of a very special \\nfuture: the volatility (VX) future, and how it can form the basis of some \\nquite lucrative strategies.\\nIn the momentum camp, we start by explaining a few statistical tests for \\ntimes series momentum. The main theme, though, is to explore the four \\nmain drivers of momentum in stocks and futures and to propose strategies \\nthat can extract time series and cross-sectional momentum. Roll returns in \\nfutures is one of those drivers, but it turns out that forced asset sales and \\npurchases is the main driver of stock and ETF momentum in many diverse \\ncircumstances. Some of the newer momentum strategies based on news \\nevents, news sentiment, leveraged ETFs, order fl  ow , and high-frequency \\ntrading will be covered. Finally, we will look at the pros and cons of mo-\\nmentum versus mean-reverting strategies and discover their diametrically \\ndiff  erent risk-return characteristics under diff  erent market regimes in re-\\ncent fi  nancial history.\\nI have always maintained that it is easy to fi  nd published, supposedly \\nprofi  table, strategies in the many books, magazines, or blogs out there, \\nbut much harder to see why they may be fl  awed and perhaps ultimately \\ndoomed.

These pitfalls can cause live trading results to diverge \\nsignifi  cantly from their backtests. As veterans of algorithmic trading will \\nalso agree, the same theoretical strategy can result in spectacular profi  ts and \\nabysmal losses, depending on the details of implementation. Hence, in this \\nbook I have lavished attention on the nitty-gritties of backtesting and some-\\ntimes live implementation of these strategies, with discussions of concepts \\nsuch as data-snooping bias, survivorship bias, primary versus consolidated \\nquotes, the venue dependence of currency quotes, the nuances of short-sale \\nconstraints, the construction of futures continuous contracts, and the use of \\nfutures closing versus settlement prices in backtests. W e also highlight some \\ninstances of “regime shift” historically when even the most correct backtest \\nwill fail to predict the future returns of a strategy.\\nI have also paid attention to choosing the right software platform for \\nbacktesting and automated execution, given that MATLAB ©, my favorite \\nlanguage, is no longer the only contender in this department. I will survey \\nthe state of the art in technology, for every level of programming skills, and \\nfor many diff  erent budgets. In particular, we draw attention to the “inte-\\ngrated development environment” for traders, ranging from the industrial-\\nstrength platforms such as Deltix to the myriad open-source versions such \\nas TradeLink. As we will explain, the ease of switching from backtesting \\nto live trading mode is the most important virtue of such platforms. The \\nfashionable concept of “complex event processing” will also be introduced \\nin this context.\\nI covered risk and money management in my previous book, which was \\nbuilt on the Kelly formula—a formula that determines the optimal lever-\\nage and capital allocation while balancing returns versus risks. I once again \\ncover risk and money management here, still based on the Kelly formula, \\nbut tempered with my practical experience in risk management involving \\nblack swans, constant proportion portfolio insurance, and stop losses. (U.S. \\nSupreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson could have been talking about \\nthe application of the Kelly formula when he said we should “temper its doc-\\ntrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom.”) W e especially focus on fi  nding \\nthe optimal leverage in realistic situations when we can no longer assume \\nGaussian distribution of returns. Also, we consider whether “risk indicators” \\nmight be a useful component of a comprehensive risk management scheme.\\nOne general technique that I have overlooked previously is the use of \\nMonte Carlo simulations.

There, I focused on basic techniques for an algorithmic trader, such \\nas how to fi  nd ideas for new strategies, how to backtest a strategy, basic \\nconsiderations in automating your executions, and, fi  nally, risk management \\nvia the Kelly formula. Y es, a few useful example strategies were sprinkled \\nthroughout, but those were not the emphasis. If you are completely new \\nto trading algorithmically, that is a good book to read. Algorithmic T rading, \\nhowever, is all about strategies.\\nAll of the examples in this book are built around MATLAB codes, and \\nthey are all available for download from www .wiley.com/go/algotrading \\nor my website at www .epchan.com/book2. Readers will fi  nd the password \\nembedded in the fi  rst example. Readers unfamiliar with MATLAB may \\nwant to study the tutorial in Quantitative T rading, or watch the free webi-\\nnars on mathworks.com. Furthermore, the MATLAB Statistics T oolbox was \\noccasionally used. (All MATLAB products are available as free trials from \\nMathW orks.)\\nSoftware and mathematics are the twin languages of algorithmic trading. \\nReaders will fi  nd this book involves somewhat more mathematics than my \\nprevious one. This is because of my desire to inject more precision in dis-\\ncussing the concepts involved in fi  nancial markets, and also because I believe \\nusing simple mathematical models for trading can be more advantageous \\nthan using the usual “data-mining” approach. That is to say, instead of throw-\\ning as many technical trading indicators or rules at a price series to see \\nwhich indicator or rule is profi  table—a practice that invites data-snooping \\nbias—we try to distill the fundamental property of that price series using \\na simple mathematical model. W e can then exploit that model to our fi  nan-\\ncial benefi  t. Nevertheless, the level of mathematics needed in the trading of \\nstocks, futures, and currencies is far lower than that needed in derivatives \\ntrading, and anyone familiar with freshman calculus, linear algebra, and sta-\\ntistics should be able to follow my discussions without problems. If you fi  nd \\nthe equations too confusing, you can just go straight to the examples and see \\ntheir concrete implementations as software codes.\\nWhen I wrote my fi  rst book, I was an independent trader, though one \\nwho had worked in the institutional investment management industry for \\nmany years. In the subsequent years, I have started and managed two hedge \\nfunds, either with a partner or by myself.

Therefore, I am more confi  dent than before that my initial approach to \\nalgorithmic trading is sound, though I have certainly learned much more in \\nthe interim. For instance, I have found that it is seldom a good idea to manu-\\nally override a model no matter how treacherous the market is looking; that \\nit is always better to be underleveraged than overleveraged, especially when \\nmanaging other people’s money; that strategy performance often mean-\\nreverts; and that overconfi  dence in a strategy is the greatest danger to us \\nall. One learns much more from mistakes and near-catastrophes than from \\nsuccesses. I strove to record much of what I have learned in the past four \\nyears in this book.\\nMy fund management experience has not changed my focus on the seri-\\nous retail trader in this book. With suffi  cient determination, and with some \\nadaptations and refi  nements, all the strategies here can be implemented by \\nan independent trader, and they do not require a seven-fi  gure brokerage ac-\\ncount, nor do they require fi  ve-fi  gure technology expenditure. My message \\nto these traders is still the same: An individual with limited resources and \\ncomputing power can still challenge powerful industry insiders at their own \\ngame.\\n ■ The Motive\\nBooks written by traders for other traders need to answer one basic ques-\\ntion: Why are they doing it? More specifi  cally, if the strategies described are \\nany good, why would the trader publicize them, which would surely render \\nthem less profi  table in the future?\\nT o answer the second question first: Many of the strategies I will \\ndescribe are quite well known to professional traders, so I am hardly \\nthrowing away any family jewels. Others have such high capacities that \\ntheir profitability will not be seriously affected by a few additional trad-\\ners running them. Y et others have the opposite properties: They are of \\nsuch low capacity, or have other unappealing limitations that I no longer \\nfind them attractive for inclusion in my own fund’s portfolio, but they \\nmay still be suitable for an individual trader’s account. Finally, I will \\noften be depicting strategies that at first sight are very promising, but \\nmay contain various pitfalls that I have not fully researched and elimi-\\nnated. For example, I have not included transaction costs in my example \\nbacktest codes, which are crucial for a meaningful backtest.

If one blithely goes ahead and backtests a strategy with-\\nout taking care to avoid these pitfalls, the backtesting will be useless. Or \\nworse—it will be misleading and may cause signifi  cant fi  nancial losses.\\nSince backtesting typically involves the computation of an expected re-\\nturn and other statistical measures of the performance of a strategy, it is \\nreasonable to question the statistical signifi  cance of these numbers. W e will \\ndiscuss various ways of estimating statistical signifi  cance using the method-\\nologies of hypothesis testing and Monte Carlo simulations. In general, the \\nmore round trip trades there are in the backtest, the higher will be the sta-\\ntistical signifi  cance.

W e will also explain why the choice of a good backtesting \\nplatform is often tied to the choice of a good automated execution platform: \\noften, the best platform combines both functions.\\n ■ The Importance of Backtesting\\nBacktesting is the process of feeding historical data to your trading strategy \\nto see how it would have performed. The hope is that its historical perfor-\\nmance tells us what to expect for its future performance. The importance of \\nthis process is obvious if you have developed a strategy from scratch, since \\nyou would certainly want to know how it has performed. But even if you \\nread about a strategy from a publication, and you trust that the author did \\nnot lie about its stated performance, it is still imperative that you indepen-\\ndently backtest the strategy. There are several reasons for this.\\nOften, the profi  tability of a strategy depends sensitively on the details \\nof implementation. For example, are the stock orders supposed to be sent \\nas market-on-open orders or as market orders just after the open? Are we \\nsupposed to send in an order for the E-mini Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 \\nfuture just before the 4:00 p .m. stock market closing time, or just before \\nthe 4:15 p .m. futures market closing time? Are we supposed to use the bid \\nor ask price to trigger a trade, or are we supposed to use the last price? All \\nthese details tend to be glossed over in a published article, often justifi  ably \\nso lest they distract from the main idea, but they can aff  ect the profi  tabil-\\nity of a live-traded strategy signifi  cantly. The only way to pin down these \\ndetails exactly, so as to implement them in our own automated execution \\nsystem, is to backtest the strategy ourselves. In fact, ideally, our backtest-\\ning program can be transformed into an automated execution program by \\nthe push of a button to ensure the exact implementation of details.\\nOnce we have implemented every detail of a strategy as a backtest pro-\\ngram, we can then put them under the microscope and look for pitfalls in \\nthe backtesting process or in the strategy itself. For example, in backtesting \\na stock portfolio strategy with both long and short positions, have we taken \\ninto account the fact that some stocks were hard to borrow and cannot easily \\nbe shorted at any reasonable size? In backtesting an intermarket pair-trading \\nstrategy in futures, have we made sure that the closing prices of the two \\nmarkets occur at the same time? The full list of pitfalls is long and tedious, \\nbut I will highlight a few common ones in the section “Common Pitfalls of ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c1290206-f3fc-42c5-a4e5-45fc1ed3dfac', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='3BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\nBacktesting.” Often, each market and each strategy presents its own very \\nspecifi  c set of pitfalls. Usually, a pitfall tends to infl  ate the backtest perfor-\\nmance of a strategy relative to its actual performance in the past, which is \\nparticularly dangerous.\\nEven if we have satisfi  ed ourselves that we have understood and imple-\\nmented every detail of a strategy in a backtesting program, and that there is \\nno pitfall that we can discover, backtesting a published strategy can still yield \\nimportant benefi  ts.\\nBacktesting a published strategy allows you to conduct true out-of-sample \\ntesting in the period following publication. If that out-of-sample performance \\nproves poor, then one has to be concerned that the strategy may have worked \\nonly on a limited data set. This is actually a more important point than people \\nrealize. Many authors will claim in their articles that the backtest results were \\n“verifi  ed with out-of-sample data.” But, actually, if the out-of-sample testing \\nresults were poor, the authors could have just changed some parameters, or \\nthey could have tweaked the model substantially so that the results look good \\nwith the “out-of-sample” data. Hence, true out-of-sample testing cannot re-\\nally begin until a strategy is published and cast in stone.\\nFinally, by backtesting a strategy ourselves, we often can fi  nd ways to \\nrefi  ne and improve the strategy to make it more profi  table or less risky. \\nThe backtesting process in trading should follow the “scientifi  c method.”  W e \\nshould start with a hypothesis about an arbitrage opportunity, maybe based \\non our own intuition about the market or from some published research. \\nW e then confi  rm or refute this hypothesis by a backtest. If the results of the \\nbacktest aren’t good enough, we can modify our hypothesis and repeat the \\nprocess.\\nAs I emphasized earlier, performance of a strategy is often very sensitive \\nto details, and small changes in these details can bring about substantial im-\\nprovements. These changes can be as simple as changing the look-back time \\nperiod for determining the moving average, or entering orders at the open \\nrather than at the close. Backtesting a strategy allows us to experiment with \\nevery detail.\\n ■ Common Pitfalls of Backtesting\\nAlthough almost every strategy allows for unique opportunities in commit-\\nting errors in backtesting, there are a number of common themes, some \\ngenerally applicable to all markets, others pertain to specifi  c ones.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8008fd5e-c1a4-45e5-8dd3-2412a6448694', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='4ALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nLook-ahead Bias\\nAs its name implies, look-ahead bias means that your backtest program is us-\\ning tomorrow’s prices to determine today’s trading signals. Or, more gener-\\nally, it is using future information to make a “prediction” at the current time. \\nA common example of look-ahead bias is to use a day’s high or low price to \\ndetermine the entry signal during the same day during backtesting. (Before \\nthe close of a trading day, we can’t know what the high and low price of the \\nday are.) Look-ahead bias is essentially a programming error and can infect \\nonly a backtest program but not a live trading program because there is no \\nway a live trading program can obtain future information. This diff  erence \\nbetween backtesting and a live trading program also points to an obvious \\nway to avoid look-ahead bias. If your backtesting and live trading programs \\nare one and the same, and the only diff  erence between backtesting versus \\nlive trading is what kind of data you are feeding into the program (historical \\ndata in the former, and live market data in the latter), then there can be no \\nlook-ahead bias in the program. Later on in this chapter, we will see which \\nplatforms allow the same source code to be used for both backtest and live \\nexecution.\\nData-Snooping Bias and the Beauty of Linearity\\nData-snooping bias is caused by having too many free parameters that are \\nfi  tted to random ethereal market patterns in the past to make historical per-\\nformance look good. These random market patterns are unlikely to recur \\nin the future, so a model fi  tted to these patterns is unlikely to have much \\npredictive power.\\nThe way to detect data-snooping bias is well known: W e should test the \\nmodel on out-of-sample data and reject a model that doesn’t pass the out-of-\\nsample test. But this is easier said than done. Are we really willing to give up \\non possibly weeks of work and toss out the model completely? Few of us are \\nblessed with such decisiveness. Many of us will instead tweak the model this \\nway or that so that it fi  nally performs reasonably well on both the in-sample \\nand the out-of-sample result. But voilà! By doing this we have just turned \\nthe out-of-sample data into in-sample data.\\nIf you are unwilling to toss out a model because of its performance on \\na fi  xed out-of-sample data set (after all, poor performance on this out-of-\\nsample data may just be due to bad luck), or if you have a small data set \\nto start with and really need to tweak the model using most of this data, \\nyou should consider the idea of cross-validation.

One reason why we prefer models with a high Sharpe ratio \\nand short maximum drawdown duration is that this almost automatically \\nensures that the model will pass the cross-validation test: the only subsets \\nwhere the model will fail the test are those rare drawdown periods.\\nThere is a general approach to trading strategy construction that can min-\\nimize data-snooping bias: make the model as simple as possible, with as few \\nparameters as possible. Many traders appreciate the second edict, but fail \\nto realize that a model with few parameters but lots of complicated trading \\nrules are just as susceptible to data-snooping bias. Both edicts lead to the \\nconclusion that nonlinear models are more susceptible to data-snooping bias \\nthan linear models because nonlinear models not only are more complicated \\nbut they usually have more free parameters than linear models.\\nSuppose we attempt to predict price by simple extrapolation of the his-\\ntorical price series. A nonlinear model would certainly fi  t the historical data \\nbetter, but that’s no guarantee that it can predict a future value better. But \\neven if we fi  x the number of parameters to be the same for a nonlinear \\nmodel versus its linear contender, one has to remember that we can usually \\napproximate a nonlinear model by Taylor-series expansion familiar from \\ncalculus. That means that there is usually a simpler, linear approximation \\ncorresponding to every nonlinear model, and a good reason has to be given \\nwhy this linear model cannot be used. (The exceptions are those singular \\ncases where the lower-order terms vanish. But such cases seldom describe \\nrealistic fi  nancial time series.)\\nAn equivalent reasoning can be made in the context of what probabil-\\nity distributions we should assume for returns. W e have heard often that the \\nGaussian distribution fails to capture extreme events in the fi  nancial market. \\nBut the problem with going beyond the Gaussian distribution is that we will \\nbe confronted with many choices of alternative distributions. Should it be a \\nStudent’s t-distribution that allows us to capture the skew and kurtosis of the \\nreturns, or should it be a Pareto distribution that dispenses with a fi  nite second \\nmoment completely? Any choice will have some element of arbitrariness, and \\nthe decision will be based on a fi  nite number of observations. Hence, Occam’s \\nrazor dictates that unless there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons \\nto support a non-Gaussian distribution, a Gaussian form should be assumed.\\nLinear models imply not only a linear price prediction formula, but also \\na linear capital allocation formula.

Often, a trader will use a Bollinger band model to cap-\\nture profi  ts from this mean-reverting price series, so that we sell (or buy) \\nwhenever the price exceeds (or falls below) a certain threshold. However, if \\nwe are forced to stick to linear models, we would be forced to sell (or buy) \\nat every price increment, so that the total market value is approximately \\nproportional to the negative deviation from the mean. In common traders’ \\nparlance, this may be called “averaging-in,” or “scaling-in,” a technique that \\nis discussed in Chapter 3.\\nY ou will fi  nd several examples of linear trading models in this book be-\\ncause the simplicity of this technique lets us illustrate the point that profi  ts \\nare not derived from some subtle, complicated cleverness of the strategy \\nbut from an intrinsic ineffi  ciency in the market that is hidden in plain sight. \\nThe impatient reader can look ahead to Example 4.2, which shows a linear \\nmean-reverting strategy between an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and its \\ncomponent stocks, or Examples 4.3 and 4.4, showing two linear long-short \\nstatistical arbitrage strategies on stocks.\\nThe most extreme form of linear predictive models is one in which \\nall the coefficients are equal in magnitude (but not necessarily in sign). \\nFor example, suppose you have identified a number of factors (  f ’s) that \\nare useful in predicting whether tomorrow’s return of a stock index is \\npositive. One factor may be today’s return, with a positive today’s re-\\nturn predicting a positive future return. Another factor may be today’s \\nchange in the volatility index (VIX), with a negative change predicting \\npositive future return. Y ou may have several such factors. If you normal-\\nize these factors by turning them first into Z-scores (using in-sample \\ndata!):\\n z (i) = (  f(i) − mean(  f  ))/std(  f  ), (1.1)\\nwhere f (i) is the ith factor, you can then predict tomorrow’s return R by\\n ∑)(=+R mean R std R sign i z i n( ) () () /i\\nn\\n.

Daniel Kahneman, the \\nNobel Prize-winning economist, wrote in his bestseller Thinking, Fast and \\nSlow that “formulas that assign equal weights to all the predictors are often \\nsuperior, because they are not aff  ected by accidents of sampling” (Kahneman, \\n2011). Equation 1.2 is a simplifi  ed version of the usual factor model used in \\nstock return prediction. While its prediction of the absolute returns may or \\nmay not be very accurate, its prediction of relative returns between stocks \\nis often good enough. This means that if we use it to rank stocks, and then \\nform a long-short portfolio by buying the stocks in the top decile and short-\\ning those in the bottom decile, the average return of the portfolio is often \\npositive.\\nActually, if your goal is just to rank stocks instead of coming up with an \\nexpected return, there is an even simpler way to combine the factors f ’s \\nwithout using Equations 1.1 and 1.2. W e can fi  rst compute the ranks(i) of a \\nstock s based on a factor f(i). Then we multiply these ranks by the sign of the \\ncorrelation between f(i) and the expected return of the stock. Finally, we \\nsum all these signed ranks to form the rank of a stock:\\n ∑ )(=rank sign i rank i ()ss i\\nn\\n. (1.3)\\nAs an example, Joel Greenblatt has famously used a two-factor model as a \\n“magic formula” to rank stocks: f(1) = return on capital and f(2) = earnings \\nyield (Greenblatt, 2006). W e are supposed to buy the top 30 ranked stocks \\nand hold them for a year. The annual percentage rate (APR) for this strategy \\nwas 30.8 percent from 1988 to 2004, compared with 12.4 percent for the \\nS&P 500. Quite a triumph of linearity!\\nIn the end, though, no matter how carefully you have tried to prevent \\ndata-snooping bias in your testing process, it will somehow creep into your \\nmodel. So we must perform a walk-forward test as a fi  nal, true out-of-\\nsample test. This walk-forward test can be conducted in the form of pa-\\nper trading, but, even better, the model should be traded with real money \\n(albeit with minimal leverage) so as to test those aspects of the strategy that \\neluded even paper trading. Most traders would be happy to fi  nd that live \\ntrading generates a Sharpe ratio better than half of its backtest value.\\nStock Splits and Dividend Adjustments\\nWhenever a company’s stock has an N-to-1 split, the stock price will be di-\\nvided by N times.

But in a backtest, \\nwe typically are looking at just the price series to determine our trading \\nsignals, not the market-value series of some hypothetical account. So unless \\nwe back-adjust the prices before the ex-date of the split by dividing them by \\nN, we will see a sudden drop in price on the ex-date, and that might trigger \\nsome erroneous trading signals. This is as true in live trading as in backtest-\\ning, so you would have to divide the historical prices by N just before the \\nmarket opens on the ex-date during live trading, too. (If it is a reverse 1-to-\\nN split, we would have to multiply the historical prices before the ex-date \\nby N.)\\nSimilarly, when a company pays a cash (or stock) dividend of $ d per \\nshare, the stock price will also go down by $ d (absent other market move-\\nments). That is because if you own that stock before the dividend ex-date, \\nyou will get cash (or stock) distributions in your brokerage account, so \\nagain there should be no change in the total market value. If you do not \\nback-adjust the historical price series prior to the ex-date, the sudden drop \\nin price may also trigger an erroneous trading signal. This adjustment, too, \\nshould be applied to any historical data used in the live trading model just \\nbefore the market opens on an ex-date. (This discussion applies to ETFs as \\nwell.

This is \\nbecause, as we saw earlier, this bias tends to infl  ate the backtest performance \\nof a long-only strategy that fi  rst buys low and then sells high, whereas it will \\ndefl  ate the backtest performance of a short-only strategy that fi  rst sells high \\nand then buys low .

If you use the \\nusual consolidated historical prices for backtesting, the results can be quite \\nunrealistic. In particular, if you use consolidated historical prices to back-\\ntest a mean-reverting model, you are likely to generate infl  ated backtest \\nperformance because a small number of shares can be executed away from \\nthe primary exchange at a price quite diff  erent from the auction price on \\nthe primary exchange. The transaction prices on the next trading day will \\nusually mean-revert from this hard-to-achieve outlier price.

T o short a stock, your broker has to be able to “locate” a quantity of \\nthese stocks from other customers or other institutions (typically mutual \\nfunds or other asset managers that have large long positions in many stocks) \\nand arrange a stock loan to you. If there is already a large short interest out \\nthere so that a lot of the shares of a company have already been borrowed, \\nor if the fl  oat of the stock is limited, then your stock can be “hard to bor-\\nrow .” Hard to borrow may mean that you, as the short seller, will have to \\npay interest to the stock lender, instead of the other way around in a normal \\nsituation. In more extreme cases, hard to borrow may mean that you cannot \\nborrow the stock in the quantity you desire or at all. After Lehman Brothers \\ncollapsed during the fi  nancial crisis of 2008–2009, the U.S. Securities and \\nExchange Commission (SEC) banned short sales in all the fi  nancial indus-\\ntry stocks for several months.

But this return is completely unrealistic. This renders \\nshort-sale constraints dangerous to backtesting. It is not easy, though, to fi  nd \\na historically accurate list of hard-to-borrow stocks for your backtest, as this \\nlist depends on which broker you use. As a general rule, small-cap stocks are \\naff  ected much more by short-sale constraint than are large-cap stocks, and \\nso the returns of their short positions are much more suspect. Bear in mind \\nalso that sometimes ETFs are as hard to borrow as stocks. I have found, for \\nexample, that I could not even borrow SPY to short in the months after the \\nLehman Brothers’ collapse!\\nAn additional short-sale constraint is the so-called “uptick rule” imposed \\nby the SEC. The original uptick rule was in eff  ect from 1938 to 2007, where \\nthe short sale had to be executed at a price higher than the last traded price, \\nor at the last traded price if that price was higher than the price of the trade \\nprior to the last. (For Nasdaq stocks, the short sale price must be higher \\nthan the last bid rather than the last trade.) The Alternative Uptick Rule that \\ntook eff  ect in 2010 also requires a short sale to have a trade price higher than \\nthe national best bid, but only when a circuit breaker has been triggered. A \\ncircuit breaker for a stock is triggered when that stock traded at 10 percent \\nlower than its previous close. The circuit breaker is in eff  ect for the follow-\\ning day after the initial trigger as well. This eff  ectively prevents any short \\nmarket orders from being fi  lled. So, again, a really accurate backtest that \\ninvolves short sales must take into account whether these constraints were \\nin eff  ect when the historical trade was supposed to occur. Otherwise, the \\nbacktest performance will be infl  ated.\\nFutures Continuous Contracts\\nFutures contracts have expiry dates, so a trading strategy on, say, crude oil \\nfutures, is really a trading strategy on many diff  erent contracts. Usually, \\nthe strategy applies to front-month contracts. Which contract is the “front \\nmonth” depends on exactly when you plan to “roll over” to the next month; \\nthat is, when you plan to sell the current front contract and buy the contract \\nwith the next nearest expiration date (assuming you are long a contract to \\nbegin with). Some people may decide to roll over 10 days before the current \\nfront contract expires; others may decide to roll over when there is an “open \\ninterest crossover”; that is, when the open interest of the next contract ex-\\nceeds that of the current front contract.

(P&L, or \\nreturn, is certainly aff  ected by the so-called “roll return,” but as we discuss \\nextensively in Chapter 5, roll return is in eff  ect every day on every contract \\nand is not a consequence of rolling over.) Fortunately, most futures histori-\\ncal data vendors also recognize this, and they usually make available what is \\nknown as “continuous contract” data.\\nW e won’t discuss here how you can go about creating a continuous con-\\ntract yourself because you can read about that on many futures historical \\ndata vendors’ websites. But there is a nuance to this process that you need \\nto be aware of. The fi  rst step in creating a continuous contract is to concat-\\nenate the prices of the front-month contract together, given a certain set of \\nrollover dates. But this results in a price series that may have signifi  cant price \\ngaps going from the last date before rollover to the rollover date, and it will \\ncreate a false return or P&L on the rollover date in your backtest.\\nT o see this, let’s say the closing price of the front contract on date T is \\np(T ), and the closing price of this same contract on date T + 1 is p(T + 1). \\nAlso, let’s say the closing price of the next nearby contract (also called the \\n“back” contract) on date T + 1 is q(T + 1). Suppose T + 1 is the rollover date, \\nso if we are long the front contract, we should sell this contract at the close \\nat p(T + 1), and then buy the next contract at q(T + 1). What’s the P&L (in \\npoints, not dollars) and return of this strategy on T + 1? The P&L is just \\np(T + 1) − p(T ), and the return is ( p(T + 1) − p(T ))/p(T ). But the unad-\\njusted continuous price series will show a price of p(T ) at T, and q(T + 1) at \\nT + 1. If you calculate P&L and return the usual way, you would have calcu-\\nlated the erroneous values of q(T + 1) − p(T ) and (q(T + 1) − p(T ))/p(T ), \\nrespectively. T o prevent this error, the data vendor can typically back-adjust \\nthe data series to eliminate the price gap, so that the P&L on T + 1 is p(T + 1) \\n− p(T ). This can be done by adding the number ( q(T + 1) − p(T + 1)) to \\nevery price p(t) on every date t on or before T, so that the price change and \\nP&L from T to T + 1 is correctly calculated as q(T + 1) − ( p(T ) + q(T + 1) \\n− p(T + 1)) = p(T + 1) − p(T ). (Of course, to take care of every rollover, \\nyou would have to apply this back adjustment multiple times, as you go back \\nfurther in the data series.)\\nIs our problem solved? Not quite. Check out what the return is at T + 1 \\ngiven this adjusted price series: ( p(T + 1) − p(T ))/( p(T ) + q(T + 1) − p(T + \\n1)), not ( p(T + 1) − p(T))/p(T ). If you back-adjust to make the P&L calcu-\\nlation correct, you will leave the return calculation incorrect.

Y ou \\nreally can’t have both. As long as you want the convenience of using a con-\\ntinuous contract series, you have to choose one performance measurement \\nonly, P&L or return. (If you bother to backtest your strategy on the various \\nindividual contracts, taking care of the rollover buying and selling yourself, \\nthen both P&L and return can be correctly calculated simultaneously.)\\nAn additional diffi  culty occurs when we choose the price back-adjustment \\ninstead of the return back-adjustment method: the prices may turn negative \\nin the distant past. This may create problems for your trading strategy, and \\nit will certainly create problems in calculating returns. A common method \\nto deal with this is to add a constant to all the prices so that none will be \\nnegative.\\nThis subtlety in picking the right back-adjustment method is more im-\\nportant when we have a strategy that involves trading spreads between \\ndiff  erent contracts. If your strategy generates trading signals based on the \\nprice diff  erence between two contracts, then you must choose the price \\nback-adjustment method; otherwise, the price diff  erence may be wrong and \\ngenerate a wrong trading signal. When a strategy involves calendar spreads \\n(spreads on contracts with the same underlying but diff  erent expiration \\ndates), this back adjustment is even more important. This is because the \\ncalendar spread is a small number compared to the price of one leg of the \\nspread, so any error due to rollover will be a signifi  cant percentage of the \\nspread and very likely to trigger a wrong signal both in backtest and in live \\ntrading. However, if your strategy generates trading signals based on the \\nratio of prices between two contracts, then you must choose the return \\nback-adjustment method.\\nAs you can see, when choosing a data vendor for historical futures prices, \\nyou must understand exactly how they have dealt with the back-adjustment \\nissue, as it certainly impacts your backtest. For example, csidata.com uses \\nonly price back adjustment, but with an optional additive constant to pre-\\nvent prices from going negative, while tickdata.com allows you the option \\nof choosing price versus return back-adjustment, but there is no option for \\nadding a constant to prevent negative prices.\\nFutures Close versus Settlement Prices\\nThe daily closing price of a futures contract provided by a data vendor \\nis usually the settlement price, not the last traded price of the contract ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='394f998a-6998-48e9-9a11-36d2b962e2d7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '15', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='15BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\nduring that day. Note that a futures contract will have a settlement price \\neach day (determined by the exchange), even if the contract has not traded \\nat all that day. And if the contract has traded, the settlement price is in \\ngeneral diff  erent from the last traded price. Most historical data vendors \\nprovide the settlement price as the daily closing price. But some, such as \\nvendors that provide tick-by-tick data, may provide actual transaction price \\nonly, and therefore the close price will be the last traded price, if there has \\nbeen a transaction on that day. Which price should we use to backtest our \\nstrategies?\\nIn most cases, we should use the settlement price, because if you had \\ntraded live near the close, that would have been closest to the price of your \\ntransaction. The last recorded trade price might have occurred several hours \\nearlier and bear little relation to your transaction price near the close. This \\nis especially important if we are constructing a pairs-trading strategy on \\nfutures. If you use the settlement prices to determine the futures spreads, \\nyou are guaranteed to be using two contemporaneous prices. (This is true \\nas long as the two futures contracts have the same underlying and therefore \\nhave the same closing time. If you are trading intermarket spreads, see the \\ndiscussion at the end of this section.) However, if you use the last traded \\nprices to determine the spread, you may be using prices generated at two \\nvery diff  erent times and therefore incorrect. This incorrectness may mean \\nthat your backtest program will be generating erroneous trades due to an \\nunrealistically large spread, and these trades may be unrealistically profi  t-\\nable in backtest when the spreads return to a correct, smaller value in the \\nfuture, maybe when near-simultaneous transactions occur. As usual, an in-\\nfl  ated backtest result is dangerous.\\nIf you have an intraday spread strategy or are otherwise using intraday \\nfutures prices for backtesting a spread strategy, you will need either histori-\\ncal data with bid and ask prices of both contracts or the intraday data on \\nthe spread itself when it is native to the exchange. This is necessary because \\nmany futures contracts are not very liquid. So if we use the last price of ev-\\nery bar to form the spread, we may fi  nd that the last prices of contract A and \\ncontract B of the same bar may actually refer to transactions that are quite \\nfar apart in time. A spread formed by asynchronous last prices could not in \\nreality be bought or sold at those prices. Backtests of intraday spread strate-\\ngies using the last price of each leg of the spread instead of the last price \\nof the spread itself will again infl  ate the resulting returns.

If the contracts are traded on diff  erent exchanges, they \\nare likely to have diff  erent closing times. So it would be wrong to form an \\nintermarket spread using their closing prices. This is true also if we try to \\nform a spread between a future and an ETF. The obvious remedy of this is \\nto obtain intraday bid-ask data so that synchronicity is assured. The other \\npossibility is to trade an ETF that holds a future instead of the future itself. \\nFor example, instead of trading the gold future GC (settlement price set \\nat 1:30 p .m.

In other words, we may just be lucky that our \\nstrategy happened to be profi  table in a small data sample. Statisticians have \\ndeveloped a general methodology called hypothesis testing  to address this \\nissue.\\nThe general framework of hypothesis testing as applied to backtesting \\nfollows these steps:\\n 1. Based on a backtest on some fi  nite sample of data, we compute a cer-\\ntain statistical measure called the test statistic. For concreteness, let’s say \\nthe test statistic is the average daily return of a trading strategy in that \\nperiod. \\n 2. W e suppose that the true average daily return based on an infi  nite data \\nset is actually zero. This supposition is called the null hypothesis.\\n 3. W e suppose that the probability distribution of daily returns is \\nknown. This probability distribution has a zero mean, based on the \\nnull hypothesis. W e describe later how we determine this probability \\ndistribution.\\n 4. Based on this null hypothesis probability distribution, we compute the \\nprobability p that the average daily returns will be at least as large as \\nthe observed value in the backtest (or, for a general test statistic, as \\nextreme, allowing for the possibility of a negative test statistic). This \\nprobability p is called the p-value, and if it is very small (let’s say smaller ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e7fbe2fb-1050-4834-a295-8256b9f59360', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '17', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='17BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\nthan 0.01), that means we can “reject the null hypothesis,” and conclude \\nthat the backtested average daily return is statistically signifi  cant.\\nThe step in this procedure that requires most thought is step 3. How do \\nwe determine the probability distribution under the null hypothesis? Per-\\nhaps we can suppose that the daily returns follow a standard parametric \\nprobability distribution such as the Gaussian distribution, with a mean of \\nzero and a standard deviation given by the sample standard deviation of the \\ndaily returns. If we do this, it is clear that if the backtest has a high Sharpe \\nratio, it would be very easy for us to reject the null hypothesis. This is be-\\ncause the standard test statistic for a Gaussian distribution is none other than \\nthe average divided by the standard deviation and multiplied by the square \\nroot of the number of data points (Berntson, 2002). The p-values for various \\ncritical values are listed in Table 1.1. For example, if the daily Sharpe ratio \\nmultiplied by the square root of the number days ( n) in the backtest is \\ngreater than or equal to the critical value 2.326, then the p-value is smaller \\nthan or equal to 0.01.\\nThis method of hypothesis testing is consistent with our belief that high-\\nSharpe-ratio strategies are more statistically signifi  cant.\\nAnother way to estimate the probability distribution of the null hy-\\npothesis is to use Monte Carlo methods to generate simulated historical \\nprice data and feed these simulated data into our strategy to determine \\nthe empirical probability distribution of profits. Our belief is that the \\nprofitability of the trading strategy captured some subtle patterns or \\ncorrelations of the price series, and not just because of the first few \\nmoments of the price distributions. So if we generate many simulated \\nprice series with the same first moments and the same length as the \\nactual price data, and run the trading strategy over all these simulated \\nprice series, we can find out in what fraction p of these price series \\nare the average returns greater than or equal to the backtest return. \\nTABLE 1.1 Critical Values for ×n  Daily Sharpe Ratio\\np-value Critical values\\n0.10 1.282\\n0.05 1.645\\n0.01 2.326\\n0.001 3.091\\nSource: Berntson (2002).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='34132698-c607-4dcd-9bb8-abc4de2de396', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '18', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='18\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nIdeally, p will be small, which allows us to reject the null hypothesis. \\nOtherwise, the average return of the strategy may just be due to the \\nmarket returns.\\nA third way to estimate the probability distribution of the null hypoth-\\nesis is suggested by Andrew Lo and his collaborators (Lo, Mamaysky, and \\nWang, 2000). In this method, instead of generating simulated price data, \\nwe generate sets of simulated trades, with the constraint that the number \\nof long and short entry trades is the same as in the backtest, and with the \\nsame average holding period for the trades. These trades are distributed \\nrandomly over the actual historical price series. W e then measure what \\nfraction of such sets of trades has average return greater than or equal to \\nthe backtest average return.\\nIn Example 1.1, I compare these three ways of testing the statistical sig-\\nnifi  cance of a backtest on a strategy. W e should not be surprised that they \\ngive us diff  erent answers, since the probability distribution is diff  erent in \\neach case, and each assumed distribution compares our strategy against a \\ndiff  erent benchmark of randomness.\\nExample 1.1: Hypothesis Testing on a Futures \\nMomentum Strategy\\nW e apply the three versions of hypothesis testing, each with \\na diff  erent probability distribution for the null hypothesis, on \\nthe backtest results of the TU momentum strategy described in \\nChapter 6. That strategy buys (sells) the TU future if it has a positive \\n(negative) 12-month return, and holds the position for 1 month. W e \\npick this strategy not only because of its simplicity, but because it has \\na fi  xed holding period. So for version 3 of the hypothesis testing, we \\nneed to randomize only the starting days of the long and short trades, \\nwith no need to randomize the holding periods.\\nThe fi  rst hypothesis test is very easy. W e assume the probability \\ndistribution of the daily returns is Gaussian, with mean zero as \\nbefi  tting a null hypothesis, and with the standard deviation given by \\nthe standard deviation of the daily returns given by our backtest.

Comparing this test \\nstatistic with the critical values in Table 1.1 tells us that we can reject \\nthe null hypothesis with better than 99 percent probability.\\nThe second hypothesis test involves generating a set of random, \\nsimulated daily returns data for the TU future (not the daily returns \\nof the strategy) for the same number of days as our backtest. These \\nrandom daily returns data will have the same mean, standard \\ndeviation, skewness, and kurtosis as the observed futures returns, \\nbut, of course, they won’t have the same correlations embedded \\nin them. If we fi  nd there is a good probability that the strategy can \\ngenerate an as good as or better return on this random returns series \\nas the observed returns series, it would mean that the momentum \\nstrategy is not really capturing any momentum or serial correlations \\nin the returns at all and is profi  table only because we were lucky that \\nthe observed returns’ probability distribution has a certain mean and \\na certain shape.

Why would we rec-\\nommend against backtesting some strategies? The fact is that there are some \\npublished strategies that are so obviously fl  awed it would be a waste of time \\nto even consider them. Given what you know now about common pitfalls of \\nbacktesting, you are in a good position to judge whether you would want to \\nbacktest a strategy without even knowing the details. W e will look at a few \\nexamples here.\\nExample 1: A strategy that has a backtest annualized return of 30 per-\\ncent and a Sharpe ratio of 0.3, and a maximum drawdown duration of \\ntwo years.\\nV ery few traders (as opposed to “investors”) have the stomach for a strat-\\negy that remains “under water” for two years. The low Sharpe ratio coupled \\nwith the long drawdown duration indicates that the strategy is not consis-\\ntent. The high average return may be just a fl  uke, and it is not likely to re-\\npeat itself when we start to trade the strategy live. Another way to say this \\nis that the high return is likely the result of data-snooping bias, and the long \\ndrawdown duration will make it unlikely that the strategy will pass a cross-\\nvalidation test. Do not bother to backtest high return but low Sharpe ratio \\nstrategies. Also, do not bother to backtest strategies with a maximum draw-\\ndown duration longer than what you or your investors can possibly endure.\\nExample 2: A long-only crude oil futures strategy returned 20 percent \\nin 2007, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5.\\nA quick check of the total return of holding the front-month crude oil fu-\\ntures in 2007 reveals that it was 47 percent, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.7.

Moral of the story: W e must always choose the appropriate bench-\\nmark to measure a trading strategy against. The appropriate benchmark of \\na long-only strategy is the return of a buy-and-hold position—the informa-\\ntion ratio rather than the Sharpe ratio.\\nExample 3: A simple “buy-low-sell-high” strategy picks the 10 lowest-\\npriced stocks at the beginning of the year and holds them for a year. \\nThe backtest return in 2001 is 388 percent.\\nThe fi  rst question that should come to mind upon reading this strategy is: \\nWas the strategy backtested using a survivorship-bias-free stock database? \\nIn other words, does the stock database include those stocks that have since \\nbeen delisted? If the database includes only stocks that have survived until \\ntoday, then the strategy will most likely pick those lucky survivors that hap-\\npened to be very cheap at the beginning of 2001. With the benefi  t of hind-\\nsight, the backtest can, of course, achieve a 388 percent return. In contrast, \\nif the database includes delisted stocks, then the strategy will most likely \\npick those stocks to form the portfolio, resulting in almost 100 percent \\nloss. This 100 percent loss would be the realized return if we had traded \\nthe strategy back in 2001, and the 388 percent return is an infl  ated backtest \\nreturn that can never be realized. If the author did not specifi  cally mention \\nthat the data used include delisted stocks, then we can assume the backtest \\nsuff  ers from survivorship bias and the return is likely to be infl  ated.\\nExample 4: A neural net trading model that has about 100 nodes gener-\\nates a backtest Sharpe ratio of 6.\\nMy alarms always go off whenever I hear the term neural net trad-\\ning model,  not to mention one that has 100 nodes. All you need to \\nknow about the nodes in a neural net is that the number of param-\\neters to be fitted with in-sample training data is proportional to the \\nnumber of nodes. With at least 100 parameters, we can certainly fit the \\nmodel to any time series we want and obtain a fantastic Sharpe ratio. \\nNeedless to say, it will have little or no predictive power going forward \\ndue to data-snooping bias.\\nExample 5: A high-frequency E-mini S&P 500 futures trading strategy \\nhas a backtest annual average return of 200 percent and a Sharpe ratio \\nof 6. Its average holding period is 50 seconds.\\nCan we really backtest a high-frequency trading strategy? The perfor-\\nmance of a high-frequency trading strategy depends on the order types \\nused and the execution method in general. Furthermore, it depends cru-\\ncially on the market microstructure.

So be very skeptical of a so-called backtest of a high-\\nfrequency strategy.\\nLife is too short to backtest every single strategy that we read about, so \\nwe hope awareness of the common pitfalls of backtesting will help you se-\\nlect what strategies to backtest.\\n ■ Will a Backtest Be Predictive of \\nFuture Returns?\\nEven if we manage to avoid all the common pitfalls outlined earlier and there \\nare enough trades to ensure statistical signifi  cance of the backtest, the predic-\\ntive power of any backtest rests on the central assumption that the statisti-\\ncal properties of the price series are unchanging, so that the trading rules \\nthat were profi  table in the past will be profi  table in the future. This assump-\\ntion is, of course, invalidated often in varying degrees: A country’s economic \\nprospect changes, a company’s management changes, and a fi  nancial market’s \\nstructure changes. In the past decade in the United States, we have witnessed \\nnumerous instances of the last category of changes. Among them:\\n ■ Decimalization of U.S. stock quotes on April 9, 2001. (Prior to this date, \\nU.S. stocks were quoted in one-eighth or one-sixteenth of a penny.) This \\ncaused bid-ask spreads to decrease, but also caused the “displayed liquidity” \\nat the best bid and ask prices to decrease (Arnuk and Saluzzi, 2012). This in \\nturn caused profi  tability of many statistical arbitrage strategies to decrease \\nwhile increasing the profi  tability of many high-frequency strategies.\\n ■ The 2008 fi  nancial crisis that induced a subsequent 50 percent collapse of \\naverage daily trading volumes (Durden, 2012). Retail trading and owner-\\nship of common stock is particularly reduced. This has led to decreasing \\naverage volatility of the markets, but with increasing frequency of sudden \\noutbursts such as that which occurred during the fl  ash crash in May 2010 and \\nthe U.S. federal debt credit rating downgrade in August 2011. The overall \\neff  ect has been a general decrease in profi  ts for mean-reverting strategies, \\nwhich thrive on a high but constant level of volatility.\\n ■ The same 2008 fi  nancial crisis, which also initiated a multiyear bear \\nmarket in momentum strategies, as discussed in Chapter 6.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3c6d7f81-f9a0-4435-a3f5-76b84c014aa7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '25', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='25BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\n ■ The SEC’s Regulation NMS implemented in July 2007, which also \\ncontributed to the drastic decrease in the average trade sizes and the ob-\\nsolescence of the NYSE block trade (Arnuk and Saluzzi, 2012).\\n ■ The removal of the old uptick rule for short sales in June 2007 and the \\nreinstatement of the new Alternative Uptick Rule in 2010.\\nStrategies that performed superbly prior to each of these “regime shifts” \\nmay stop performing and vice versa.

W e are faced with two basic choices \\nwhen it comes to deciding on a trading platform:\\n 1. Buying a special-purpose backtesting and execution platform, and \\nimplementing your strategy using that platform’s special-purpose \\ngraphical user interface (GUI) or programming language.\\n 2.

(Note that Deltix and \\nProgress Apama also allow other ways to specify a strategy, as explained \\nbelow .)\\nTraders possessing the next level of programming skill should consider \\nimplementing both backtesting and automated execution using one of the \\nscripting languages.

But it is actually quite hard to build a reasonably \\ncomplicated strategy in Excel, and even harder to debug it.

If you use Excel for automated \\nexecutions, you may fi  nd that you have to use DDE links provided by your \\nbrokerage for market data updates, and you will likely need to add Visual \\nBasic macros to handle more complicated trading logic, which is quite in-\\neffi  cient.

It is a true tick-driven application: \\nEvery tick (in the FX case, a tick is a new quote) triggers a recalculation of \\nall the values in all of the cells of the spreadsheet. Furthermore, it has an \\ninternal cache for real-time data so that different cells that require the same \\ndata to compute can simply retrieve it from the cache, instead of duplicating \\nsubscriptions of the same data. It is also a true multithreaded platform at two \\ndifferent levels. First, different strategies written on different Excel workbooks \\ncan get market data updates and submit orders simultaneously. Second, \\ndifferent cells within the same workbook can also get updates and act on \\nnew data simultaneously. That is to say, even if the calculation in one cell \\nhappens to take very long to complete, it will not prevent other cells from \\nresponding to a new tick by, say, submitting an order.

Aside from the institutional platforms mentioned here, \\nmany retail traders are familiar with MetaTrader, NinjaTrader, Trading \\nBlox, or TradeStation Easy Language. I have not tried all of these platforms \\npersonally, but I have a lingering suspicion that despite the apparent ease of \\nuse and other advantages I mention later, they all in some way place some \\nlimitations on the type of strategies that can be backtested and executed.\\nRequiring just slightly more skills than programming in VB, traders will \\nfi  nd the scripting languages of MATLAB, R, and Python off  er vastly more \\nease of debugging, much greater fl  exibility in the type of strategies that can \\nbe backtested, and higher effi  ciency in backtesting large data sets. These are \\nwhat we call “REPL” languages. REPL is programmer-speak for “Read-Eval-\\nPrint-Loop.” That is, you can type in a mathematical expression, and the \\nprogram will immediately evaluate it and print out the answer, and get ready \\nfor you to input the next expression. It works exactly like a handheld cal-\\nculator, but better: Y ou can also save all these expressions in a fi  le, and have \\nthe program automatically execute them sequentially. The syntax of these \\nlanguages is designed to be more intuitive and easier to understand than \\nconventional programming languages such as C++ and much more fl  exible \\nin terms of the type of variables that can be used in a program. Scalars, ar-\\nrays, and strings are all basically dealt with using a similar syntax and passed \\nalong to functions in the same way.\\nMATLAB can also utilize Java, C++, or C# libraries or application pro-\\ngramming interfaces (APIs) and call functions implemented in those librar-\\nies or APIs. This allows MATLAB  to take advantage of the more effi  cient \\nimplementations in those conventional languages when a task is particularly \\ncomputationally intensive. Also, there are far more libraries and APIs that \\nare written in those conventional languages than those written in MATLAB, \\nR, or Python, so this feature is often essential.\\nMany algorithmic traders are aware that MATLAB, R, and Python are \\nexcellent languages for backtesting. But less well known is the fact that \\nthey can be turned into execution platforms as well with the addition \\nof some toolboxes. Most brokerages have APIs written in Java, C++, or \\nC#; and, as I said earlier, MATLAB can call functions in APIs written in \\nsuch languages, though it does take some familiarity with these languages ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='4ac85211-95e8-428c-8800-57538cb4ebd2', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '29', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='29BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\nto know how to call these functions. If you would prefer a solution that \\nobviates making “foreign-language” API calls in MATLAB, there are a \\nnumber of commercial products available.

Another vendor, www .exchangeapi.com, \\nhas a similar API called quant2ib, as well as one called quant2tt for con-\\nnecting MATLAB to Trading T echnologies. For other brokerages, www .\\npracplay.com off  ers a bridge from MATLAB or R to 15 or more brokers \\nfor a monthly fee. A free, open-source MATLAB API for connecting to \\nInteractive Brokers was developed by Jev Kuznetsov and is available for \\ndownload from MATLAB Central’s File Exchange. Meanwhile, the MAT -\\nFIX software from agoratron.com lets your MATLAB program send or-\\nders using the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol to brokers \\nor exchanges. Y ou can also use MATLAB to call the Java or .NET func-\\ntions in QuickFIX, an open source FIX engine (Kozola, 2012). For Py-\\nthon users, the free, open-source software IbPy will connect your Python \\ntrading program to Interactive Brokers. While these add-ons to MATLAB \\nand Python make it possible to connect to a broker, they nevertheless do \\nnot shield you from all the complexity of such connections. And, more \\nimportant, it is cumbersome to use the same program for both backtest-\\ning and execution.\\nIf you are a hard-core programmer, you will, of course, have no prob-\\nlem backtesting and automating execution directly in the most fl  exible, \\nmost effi  cient, and most robust of programming languages, such as afore-\\nmentioned trio of Java, C++, or C#. As I said earlier, all brokerages or \\nexchanges that cater to algorithmic traders provide APIs in one or more \\nof these languages, or they allow you to submit orders using the FIX \\nmessages, which in turn can be created and transmitted using a program \\nwritten in one of these languages. (For example, QuickFIX, mentioned \\npreviously, is available in C++, C#, VB, Python, and Ruby.) But even \\nhere the software industry has come to make our strategy implementation \\neasier and more robust by providing IDEs designed just for backtesting. \\nIn fact, many of the special-purpose trading platforms (Deltix, Progress \\nApama, QuantHouse, RTD Tango, etc.) include ways for coding strategies \\nusing general-purpose, advanced programming languages that make them \\nresemble IDEs.

Meanwhile, special-purpose backtesting platforms \\ntypically come integrated with historical data. So for many special-purpose \\ntrading platforms, the backtest program can be made the same as the live \\nexecution program by factoring out the pure trading logic into a function, \\nunencumbered with details of how to retrieve data or where to submit or-\\nders, and switching between backtesting mode and live execution mode can \\nbe done by pushing a button to switch between feeding in historical data \\nversus live market data.\\nThis ease of switching between backtesting and live execution is more \\nthan just convenience: It eliminates any possibility of discrepancies or er-\\nrors in transcribing a backtest strategy into a live strategy, discrepancies that \\noften plague strategies written in a general programming language whether \\nit is C++ or MATLAB. Just as importantly, it eliminates the possibility of \\nlook-ahead bias. As explained before, look-ahead bias means mistakenly in-\\ncorporating future, unknowable information as part of the historical data \\ninput to the backtest engine. Special-purpose platforms feed in historical \\nmarket data into the trade generating engine one tick or one bar at a time, \\njust as it would feeding in live market data. So there is no possibility that \\nfuture information can be used as input. This is one major advantage of using \\na special-purpose trading platform.\\nThere is one more advantage in using a platform where the backtesting \\nand live execution programs are one and the same—it enables true tick-\\nbased high-frequency trading strategies backtesting. This is because most in-\\ndustrial-strength live execution programs are “event-driven”; that is, a trade \\nis triggered by the arrival of a new tick, not the end of an arbitrary time \\nbar. So if the input historical data is also tick-based, we can also backtest a \\nhigh-frequency strategy that depends on the change of every tick or even \\nevery change in the order book. (I said “in theory” assuming that your hard-\\nware is powerful enough. Otherwise, see the discussion later in this chapter \\nin the section “What Type of Asset Classes or Strategies Does the Platform \\nSupport?”) Of course, we can backtest tick-based strategies in MATLAB by \\nfeeding every tick into the program as well, though that is quite a cumber-\\nsome procedure.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b226a765-82ff-4903-ad07-0bb5427d8d87', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '31', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='31BACKTESTING AND AUTOMATED EXECUTION\\nIf you are a competent programmer who prefers the fl  exibility of a general \\npurpose programming language, yet you want to use the same program for \\nboth backtesting and live trading because of the preceding considerations, \\nyou can still use the institutional-grade special-purpose platforms as IDEs, \\nor you can use the many open-source IDEs available: Marketcetera, Trade-\\nLink, Algo- Trader, ActiveQuant. I call them IDEs, but they are more than \\njust a trading strategy development environment: They come with libraries \\nthat deal with the nuts and bolts of connecting to and exchanging data with \\nyour broker, much like a special-purpose platform does.

For example, the popular MetaTrader is for currencies \\ntrading only. It is especially diffi  cult for these platforms to trade strate-\\ngies that involve arbitrage between diff  erent asset classes, such as between \\nfutures and stocks or currencies and futures. The open-source IDEs are bet-\\nter able to handle these situations. As Table 1.2 indicates, most IDEs can \\ntrade a variety of asset classes. But, as usual, the most fl  exible solution in this \\nrespect is a stand-alone program written outside of any IDE.\\nBeyond asset classes, many special-purpose platforms also place restric-\\ntions on the type of strategies that they support even within one asset class. \\nOften, simple pairs trading strategies require special modules to handle. Most \\nlower-end platforms cannot handle common statistical arbitrage or portfolio \\ntrading strategies that involve many symbols. Open-source IDEs do not have \\nsuch restrictions, and, of course, neither do stand-alone programs.\\nWhat about high(er)-frequency trading? What kind of platforms can sup-\\nport this demanding trading strategy? The surprising answer is that most \\nplatforms can handle the execution part of high-frequency trading without \\ntoo much latency (as long as your strategy can tolerate latencies in the 1- to \\n10-millisecond range), and since special-purpose platforms as well as IDEs \\ntypically use the same program for both backtesting and execution, back-\\ntesting shouldn’t in theory be a problem either.\\nT o understand why most platforms have no trouble handling high-\\nfrequency executions, we have to realize that most of the latency that needs \\nto be overcome in high-frequency trading is due to live market data latency, \\nor brokerage order confi  rmation latency.\\n 1. Live market data latency:\\nFor your program to receive a new quote or trade price within 1 to \\n10 milliseconds (ms), you have to colocate your program at the ex-\\nchange or in your broker’s data center (see Box 1.2); furthermore, \\nyou have to receive a direct data feed from the exchanges involved, not \\nfrom a consolidated data feed such as SIAC’s Consolidated Tape System \\n(CTS). (For example, Interactive Brokers’ data feed only off  ers snap-\\nshots of market data every 250 ms.)\\n 2. Brokerage order confi  rmation latency:\\nIf a strategy submits limit orders, it will depend on a timely order sta-\\ntus confi  rmation before it can decide what to do next.

Stretching the \\ndefi  nition a bit, it can mean installing your trading program in a cloud server or \\nVPS (virtual private server) such as Amazon’s EC2, slicehost.com, or gogrid.\\ncom. The advantage of doing so is to prevent power or Internet outages \\nthat are more likely to strike a private home or offi  ce than a commercial data \\ncenter, with its backup power supply and redundant network connectivity. \\nColocating in a cloud server does not necessarily shorten the time data take \\nto travel between your brokerage or an exchange to your trading program, \\nsince many homes or offi  ces are now equipped with a fi  ber optics connection \\nto their Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon’s FiOS in the United States, and \\nBell’s Fibe Internet in Canada). To verify whether colocating in a virtual private \\nserver (VPS) actually reduces this latency, you would need to conduct a test \\nyourself by “pinging” your broker’s server to see what the average round \\ntrip time is. Certainly, if your VPS happens to be located physically close to \\nyour broker or exchange, and if they are directly connected to an Internet \\nbackbone, this latency will be smaller. (For example, pinging the Interactive \\nBrokers’ quote server from my home desktop computer produces an average \\nround trip time of about 55 ms, pinging the same server from Amazon’s EC2 \\ntakes about 25 ms, and pinging it from various VPSs located near Interactive \\nBrokers takes about 16 to 34 ms.)\\nI mention VPS only because many trading programs are not so compu-\\ntationally intensive as to require their own dedicated servers. But if they are, \\nyou can certainly upgrade to such services at many of the hosting companies \\nfamiliar with the requirements of the fi  nancial trading industry such as Equinix \\nand Telx, both of whom operate data centers in close proximity to the various \\nexchanges.\\nIf your server is already in a secure location (whether that is your offi  ce \\nor a data center) and is immune to power outage, then all you need is a \\nfast connection to your broker or the exchange. You can consider using \\nan “extranet,” which is like the Internet but operated by a private company, \\nwhich will guarantee a minimum communication speed. BT Radianz, Savvis, \\nand TNS are examples of such companies. If you have a large budget, you \\ncan also ask these companies to build a dedicated communication line from \\nyour server to your broker or exchange as well.\\nThe next step up in the colocation hierarchy is colocating inside your \\nbrokerage’s data center, so that quotes or orders confi  rmation generated \\nby your broker are transmitted to your program via an internal network, \\nunmolested by the noise and vagaries of the public Internet. Various brokers \\nthat cater to professional traders have made available colocation service: \\nexamples are Lime Brokerage and FXCM.

This is likely to be an expensive proposition (except \\nfor forex ECNs), and useful only if you have a prime broker relationship, which \\nallows you to have “sponsored access” to connect to the exchange without \\ngoing through the broker’s infrastructure (Johnson, 2010). Such prime broker \\nrelationships can typically be established only if you can generate institutional-\\nlevel commissions or have multimillion-dollar account. The requirements as \\nwell as expenses to establish colocation are lower for forex prime brokers and \\nECNs. Most forex ECNs including Currenex, EBS, FXall, and Hotspot operate \\nwithin large commercial data centers such as Equinix’s NY4 facility, and it is \\nnot too expensive to colocate at that facility or sign up with a VPS that does.\\nSome traders have expressed concern that colocating their trading \\nprograms on a remote server exposes them to possible theft of their \\nintellectual property. The simplest way is eliminate this risk is to just store \\n“executables” (binary computer codes that look like gibberish to humans) \\non these remote servers, and not the source code of your trading algorithm. \\n(Even with a MATLAB program, you can convert all the .m fi  les to .p fi  les \\nbefore loading them to the remote server.) Without source codes, no one \\ncan know the operating instructions of running the trading program, and no \\none will be foolish enough to risk capital on trading a black-box strategy of \\nwhich they know little about. For the truly paranoid, you can also require an \\never-changing password that depends on the current time to start a program.\\nensuring that no high-frequency trading can be done. Even if your bro-\\nkerage has order confi  rmation latency below 10 ms, or if they allow \\nyou to have direct market access to the exchanges so you get your order \\nstatus confi  rmation directly from the exchanges, you would still need \\nto colocate your program with either your broker in the former case, \\nor with the exchange in the latter case.\\n Practically any software program (other than Excel running with a \\nVB macro) takes less than 10 ms to submit a new order after receiving \\nthe latest market data and order status updates, so software or hardware \\nlatency is usually not the bottleneck for high-frequency trading, unless \\nyou are using one program to monitor thousands of symbols. (Concern-\\ning this last point, see Box 1.3 for issues related to multithreading.) But \\nbacktesting a high-frequency strategy is entirely a diff  erent matter.

I will \\ndiscuss more on the topic of event-driven trading in Chapter 7.\\nDoes the Platform Have Complex \\nEvent Processing?\\nComplex event processing  (CEP) is a fashionable term to describe a program \\nresponding to an event instantaneously and taking appropriate action. The \\nevents that concern us are usually the arrival of a new tick, or the delivery \\nof a news item. For an algorithmic trader, one important point is that the \\nprogram is event driven, and not bar driven. That is, the program does not \\ngo poll prices or news items at the end of each bar and then decide what to \\ndo. Because CEP is event driven, there is no delay between the occurrence \\nof an event and the response to it.\\nIf instantaneity is the only strength of CEP , then we can just use the so-\\ncalled callback functions that almost every brokerage API provides. A call-\\nback function is also triggered whenever a new tick or news item arrives, \\nand based on this new data we can perform all kinds of computations and \\ndetermine whether to submit an order. This is easy when the rule required \\nis simply “moving average of the price over the last hour.”\\nBut what if the rules are “complex,” such as “sell when the order fl  ow in \\nthe last half hour is positive, the price is above the moving average, the vola-\\ntility is low , and an important news item just arrived”?\\nWhat if the rule involves many clauses like during, between, afterwards, in \\nparallel when applied to the sequence of events? According to CEP afi  cionados, \\nit is much more succinct to express these complicated rules using a CEP lan-\\nguage than a traditional programming language. But what about the argument \\nthat trading rules should be simple to avoid data-snooping bias? Their answer \\nis that they are not data mining the data to fi  nd arbitrary rules, but simply \\nimplementing rules that seasoned traders already know are profi  table.

Figure 2.1 shows the water level of the Nile from 622 ad \\nto 1284 ad, clearly a mean-reverting time series. Mean reversion is equally \\nprevalent in the social sciences. Daniel Kahneman cited a famous example: \\nthe “Sports Illustrated jinx,” which is the claim that “an athlete whose picture \\nappears on the cover of the magazine is doomed to perform poorly the fol-\\nlowing season” (Kahneman, 2011). The scientifi  c reason is that an athlete’s \\nperformance can be thought of as randomly distributed around a mean, so \\nan exceptionally good performance one year (which puts the athlete on the \\ncover of Sports Illustrated) is very likely to be followed by performances that \\nare closer to the average. \\nIs mean reversion also prevalent in fi  nancial price series? If so, our lives as \\ntraders would be very simple and profi  table! All we need to do is to buy low \\n(when the price is below the mean), wait for reversion to the mean price, \\nand then sell at this higher price, all day long. Alas, most price series are \\nnot mean reverting, but are geometric random walks. The returns, not the \\nprices, are the ones that usually randomly distribute around a mean of zero. \\nUnfortunately, we cannot trade on the mean reversion of returns. (One \\nshould not confuse mean reversion of returns with anti-serial-correlation \\nof returns, which we can defi  nitely trade on. But anti-serial-correlation of \\nreturns is the same as the mean reversion of prices.)

By prefabricated I meant those price series \\nthat represent assets traded in the public exchanges or markets.\\nFortunately, we can manufacture many more mean-reverting price series \\nthan there are traded assets because we can often combine two or more \\nindividual price series that are not mean reverting into a portfolio whose \\nnet market value (i.e., price) is mean reverting. Those price series that can \\nbe combined this way are called cointegrating, and we will describe the \\nstatistical tests (CADF test and Johansen test) for cointegration, too.

There is another kind of mean reversion, called “cross-\\nsectional” mean reversion. Cross-sectional mean reversion means that the \\ncumulative returns of the instruments in a basket will revert to the cumula-\\ntive return of the basket. This also implies that the short-term relative re-\\nturns of the instruments are serially anticorrelated. (Relative return of an \\ninstrument is the return of that instrument minus the return of the basket.) \\nSince this phenomenon occurs most often for stock baskets, we will discuss \\nhow to take advantage of it in Chapter 4 when we discuss mean-reverting \\nstrategies for stocks and ETFs. \\n ■ Mean Reversion and Stationarity\\nMean reversion and stationarity are two equivalent ways of looking at the \\nsame type of price series, but these two ways give rise to two diff  erent sta-\\ntistical tests for such series.\\nThe mathematical description of a mean-reverting price series is that the \\nchange of the price series in the next period is proportional to the diff  erence \\nbetween the mean price and the current price. This gives rise to the ADF \\ntest, which tests whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the propor-\\ntionality constant is zero.\\nHowever, the mathematical description of a stationary price series is that \\nthe variance of the log of the prices increases slower than that of a geo-\\nmetric random walk. That is, their variance is a sublinear function of time, \\nrather than a linear function, as in the case of a geometric random walk. \\nThis sublinear function is usually approximated by τ2H, where τ is the time \\nseparating two price measurements, and H is the so-called Hurst exponent, \\nwhich is less than 0.5 if the price series is indeed stationary (and equal to \\n0.5 if the price series is a geometric random walk). The Variance Ratio test \\ncan be used to see whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the Hurst \\nexponent is actually 0.5.\\nNote that stationarity is somewhat of a misnomer: It doesn’t mean that \\nthe prices are necessarily range bound, with a variance that is independent \\nof time and thus a Hurst exponent of zero. It merely means that the variance \\nincreases slower than normal diff  usion.\\nA clear mathematical exposition of the ADF and Variance Ratio tests can \\nbe found in Walter Beckert’s course notes (Beckert, 2011).

The \\nADF test is based on just this observation.\\nW e can describe the price changes using a linear model:\\nΔy(t) = λy(t − 1) + μ + βt + α1Δy(t − 1) + … + αkΔy(t − k) + ∋\\nt (2.1)\\nwhere Δy(t) ≡ y(t) − y(t − 1), Δy(t − 1) ≡ y(t − 1) − y(t − 2), and so on. The ADF \\ntest will fi  nd out if λ = 0. If the hypothesis λ = 0 can be rejected, that means the \\nnext move Δy(t) depends on the current level y(t − 1), and therefore it is not a \\nrandom walk. The test statistic is the regression coeffi  cient λ (with y(t − 1) as \\nthe independent variable and Δy(t) as the dependent variable) divided by the \\nstandard error of the regression fi  t: λ/SE(λ). The statisticians Dickey and Fuller \\nhave kindly found out for us the distribution of this test statistic and tabulated \\nthe critical values for us, so we can look up for any value of λ/SE(λ) whether \\nthe hypothesis can be rejected at, say, the 95 percent probability level. \\nNotice that since we expect mean regression, λ/SE(λ) has to be negative, \\nand it has to be more negative than the critical value for the hypothesis to \\nbe rejected. The critical values themselves depend on the sample size and \\nwhether we assume that the price series has a non-zero mean −μ/λ or a \\nsteady drift −βt/λ. In practical trading, the constant drift in price, if any, \\ntends to be of a much smaller magnitude than the daily fl  uctuations in price. \\nSo for simplicity we will assume this drift term to be zero (β = 0). \\nIn Example 2.1, we apply the ADF test to a currency rate series \\nUSD.CAD.\\nExample 2.1: Using ADF  Test for Mean Reversion\\nThe ADF test is available as a MATLAB Econometrics function adftest, \\nor from the open-source MATLAB package spatial-econometrics.com’s \\nadf function.

This connection between a \\nregression coeffi  cient λ and the half-life of mean reversion is very useful \\nto traders.

Though we usually \\nassume the mean of a price series to be fi  xed, in practice it may change slowly \\ndue to changes in the economy or corporate management. As for the standard \\ndeviation, recall that Equation 2.4 implies even a “stationary” price series with \\n0 < H < 0.5 has a variance that increases with time, though not as rapidly as a \\ngeometric random walk. So it is appropriate to use moving average and standard \\ndeviation to allow ourselves to adapt to an ever-evolving mean and standard de-\\nviation, and also to capture profi  t more quickly.

Can’t we just run a backtest \\non the trading strategy directly and be done with it? The reason why we \\nwent through all these preliminary tests is that their statistical signifi  cance is \\nusually higher than a direct backtest of a trading strategy. These preliminary \\ntests make use of every day’s (or, more generally, every bar’s) price data for \\nthe test, while a backtest usually generates a signifi  cantly smaller number \\nof round trip trades for us to collect performance statistics. Furthermore, \\nthe outcome of a backtest is dependent on the specifi  cs of a trading strategy, \\nwith a specifi  c set of trading parameters.

The most common com-\\nbination is that of two price series: W e long one asset and simultaneously \\nshort another asset, with an appropriate allocation of capital to each asset. \\nThis is the familiar “pairs trading” strategy. But the concept of cointegration \\neasily extends to three or more assets. And in this section, we will look at \\ntwo common cointegration tests: the CADF and the Johansen test. The for-\\nmer is suitable only for a pair of price series, while the latter is applicable to \\nany number of series. \\nCointegrated Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\\nAn inquisitive reader may ask: Why do we need any new tests for the sta-\\ntionarity of the portfolio price series, when we already have the trusty ADF \\nand Variance Ratio tests for stationarity? The answer is that given a number \\nof price series, we do not know a priori what hedge ratios we should use to \\ncombine them to form a stationary portfolio. (The hedge ratio of a particu-\\nlar asset is the number of units of that asset we should be long or short in a \\nportfolio. If the asset is a stock, then the number of units corresponds to the \\nnumber of shares. A negative hedge ratio indicates we should be short that \\nasset.) Just because a set of price series is cointegrating does not mean that \\nany random linear combination of them will form a stationary portfolio. But \\npursuing this line of thought further, what if we fi  rst determine the optimal \\nhedge ratio by running a linear regression fi  t between two price series, use \\nthis hedge ratio to form a portfolio, and then fi  nally run a stationarity test on \\nthis portfolio price series?

Using \\nEnglish and Greek capital letters to represent vectors and matrices respec-\\ntively, we can rewrite Equation 2.1 as \\n ΔY(t) = ΛY(t − 1) + M + A1ΔY(t − 1) + … + Ak ΔY(t − k) + ∋\\nt (2.7)\\nJust as in the univariate case, if Λ = 0, we do not have cointegration. \\n(Recall that if the next move of Y doesn’t depend on the current price level, \\nthere can be no mean reversion.)

The Johansen test \\nwill calculate r for us in two diff  erent ways, both based on eigenvector de-\\ncomposition of Λ. One test produces the so-called trace statistic, and other \\nproduces the eigen statistic. (A good exposition can be found in Sorensen, \\n2005.) W e need not worry what they are exactly, since the jplv7 package \\nwill provide critical values for each statistic to allow us to test whether we \\ncan reject the null hypotheses that r = 0 (no cointegrating relationship), \\nr  ≤  1, …, up to r ≤ n – 1.

Why does EWA cointegrate with EWC? That’s \\nbecause both the Canadian and the Australian economies are dominated by \\ncommodities. Why does GDX cointegrate with GLD? That’s because the \\nvalue of gold-mining companies is very much based on the value of gold. \\nEven when a cointegrating pair falls apart (stops cointegrating), we can of-\\nten still understand the reason. For example, as we explain in Chapter 4, \\nthe reason GDX and GLD fell apart around the early part of 2008 was high \\nenergy prices, which caused mining gold to be abnormally expensive. W e \\nhope that with understanding comes remedy. This availability of fundamen-\\ntal reasoning is in contrast to many momentum strategies whose only justi-\\nfi  cation is that there are investors who are slower than we are in reacting to \\nthe news. More bluntly, we must believe there are greater fools out there. \\nBut those fools do eventually catch up to us, and the momentum strategy in \\nquestion may just stop working without explanation one day.\\nAnother advantage of mean-reverting strategies is that they span a great \\nvariety of time scales. At one extreme, market-making strategies rely on \\nprices that mean-revert in a matter of seconds. At the other extreme, fun-\\ndamental investors invest in undervalued stocks for years and patiently wait \\nfor their prices to revert to their “fair” value. The short end of the time scale \\nis particularly benefi  cial to traders like ourselves, since a short time scale \\nmeans a higher number of trades per year, which in turn translates to higher \\nstatistical confi  dence and higher Sharpe ratio for our backtest and live trad-\\ning, and ultimately higher compounded return of our strategy.\\nUnfortunately, it is because of the seemingly high consistency of mean-\\nreverting strategy that may lead to its eventual downfall. As Michael \\nDever pointed out, this high consistency often lulls traders into over-\\nconfi  dence and overleverage as a result (Dever, 2011). (Think Long T erm \\nCapital Management.) When a mean-reverting strategy suddenly breaks \\ndown, perhaps because of a fundamental reason that is discernible only \\nin hindsight, it often occurs when we are trading it at maximum leverage \\nafter an unbroken string of successes. So the rare loss is often very painful \\nand sometimes catastrophic. Hence, risk management for mean reverting \\nis particularly important, and particularly diffi   cult since the usual stop \\nlosses cannot be logically deployed.

In the case of just two stocks, this reduces to a spread familiar to many \\npair traders:\\n y = y1 − h y2. (3.2)\\n(W e inserted a minus sign in Equation 3.2 to anticipate the fact that we will \\nusually be long one stock and short another, so that h as defi  ned this way will \\nbe positive.)

How do we interpret this equation, since q (for “query”) \\nis just a name given to a stationary time series that may or may not be the \\nmarket value of a portfolio? T o fi  nd out its properties, let’s take its fi  rst dif-\\nference in time:\\n Δlog(q) = h1Δlog(  y1) + h2Δlog(  y2) + … + hnΔlog (  yn). (3.4)\\nRemembering that Δ log (x) ≡ log (x(t)) − log (x (t − 1)) = log (x(t)/x(t − 1)) \\n≈ Δ x/x for small changes in x, the right hand side of Equation 3.4 be-\\ncomes h1Δ y1/y1 + h2 Δ y2/y2 + … + hn Δ yn/yn, which is none other than \\nthe returns of a portfolio consisting of the n assets with weights h’s. But \\nunlike the hedge ratio h’s in Equation 3.1 where they referred to the \\nnumber of shares of each asset, here we can set the market value of each \\nasset to h. So we can interpret q as the market value of a portfolio of assets \\nwith prices y1, y2, …, yn and with constant capital weights h1, h2, …, hn, \\ntogether with a cash component implicitly included, and this market val-\\nue will form a stationary time series. Note that a cash component must \\nbe implicitly included in the portfolio q because if the capital weights \\nh’s are kept constant, there is no other way that the market value of the \\nportfolio can vary with time. This cash does not show up in Equation 3.4 \\nbecause its market value, of course, doesn’t change from t − 1 to t as a \\nresult of market movement, but its value will change at t when the trader \\nrebalances the portfolio to maintain the constancy of the capital weights, \\nrealizing some of the gains or losses, and adding to or subtracting from \\nthe cash balance. So to keep the market value of this portfolio stationary \\n(but not constant!) requires a lot of work for the traders, as they need \\nto constantly rebalance the portfolio, which is necessitated by using the \\nlog of prices. \\nThe upshot of all these is that mean reversion trading using price \\nspreads is simpler than using log price spreads, but both can be theo-\\nretically justifi  ed if both price and log price series are cointegrating. But \\nwhat about the ratio of prices y1/y2 that many traders favor as the signal \\nfor a pair? If we look at Equation 3.1 in the case of just two price se-\\nries, we notice that if h1 = −h2, then indeed log( y1/y2) or y1/y2 is sta-\\ntionary. But this is a special case: W e normally don’t expect the hedge \\nratios to be equal in magnitude, or equal to −1 if we normalize them. \\nSo the ratio y1/y2 does not necessarily form a stationary series.

Suppose price A = $10 and price \\nB = $5 initially, so the ratio is 2. After some time, price A increases to \\n$100 and price B to $50. The spread has gone from $5 to $50, and we \\nwill probably fi  nd that it is not stationary. But the ratio remains 2, and a \\nmean-reverting strategy that trades based on ratio can be equally eff  ec-\\ntive whether their prices are $10 versus $5 or $100 versus $50. In other \\nwords, if your two assets are not really cointegrating but you believe their \\nspread is still mean reverting on a short time frame, then using ratio as an \\nindicator may work better than either price spreads or log price spreads. \\n(This is the same idea as using moving average and standard deviation in \\nour linear mean-reverting strategy.)\\nThere is another good reason to use ratio when a pair is not truly coin-\\ntegrating. For such pairs, we often need to use a dynamically changing \\nhedge ratio to construct the spread. But we can dispense with this trouble \\nif we use the ratio as a signal in this situation. But does a ratio work bet-\\nter than an adaptive hedge ratio with price (or log price) spreads? I don’t \\nknow a general answer to this, but we can look at Example 3.1, where \\nwe compare the use of price spreads, log price spreads, and ratios in \\nthe linear mean reversion strategy involving GLD and USO, the gold \\nand the crude oil exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Y ou will fi  nd, in that \\nexample at least, price spreads with an adaptive hedge ratio work much \\nbetter than ratio.\\nAn interesting special case is currency trading. If we trade the currency \\npair EUR.GBP , we are using ratio because this is exactly equal to trading \\nEUR.USD/GBP .USD. W e already demonstrated a simple mean-reverting \\nstrategy on trading such currency pairs in Example 2.5 for USD.CAD using \\nratio as the signal. But about those pairs that have no ready-made cross rates \\non many brokerages or exchanges, such as MXN.NOK? Should we use the \\nratio USD.NOK/USD.MXN as the signal, or the spread USD.NOK–USD\\n.MXN instead? Again, because MXN.NOK is not truly stationary, using the \\nratio MXN.NOK may be more eff  ective. This is true even though we can’t \\ndirectly trade MXN.NOK, and have to trade USD.NOK and USD.MXN \\ninstead.

This simple strategy is chosen because it \\nis virtually parameterless, and therefore least subject to data-snooping bias. \\nWhile this linear strategy is useful for demonstrating whether mean rever-\\nsion trading can be profi  table for a given portfolio, it is not practical because \\nwe don’t know beforehand what the maximum capital deployed will be, as \\nthere is no limit to the temporary deviation of the price from its average. \\nFor practical trading, we can use the Bollinger band, where we enter into \\na position only when the price deviates by more than entryZscore standard \\ndeviations from the mean. entryZscore is a free parameter to be optimized in \\na training set, and both standard deviation and mean are computed within \\na look-back period, whose length again can be a free parameter to be op-\\ntimized, or it can be set equal to the half-life of mean reversion. W e can \\nexit when the price mean-reverts to exitZscore standard deviations from the \\nmean, where exitZscore < entryZscore. Note that if exitZscore = 0, this means \\nwe will exit when the price mean-reverts to the current mean. If exitZscore \\n= −entryZscore, we will exit when the price moves beyond the opposite band \\nso as to trigger a trading signal of the opposite sign. At any one time, we can \\nhave either zero or one unit (long or short) invested, so it is very easy to \\nallocate capital to this strategy or to manage its risk.

The advantage of being able to exit \\nwhenever the price reverts by a small increment is that even if the price \\nseries is not really stationary and therefore never really reverts to its mean, \\nwe can still be profi  table by constantly realizing small profi  ts. An added ben-\\nefi  t is that if you are trading large sizes, scaling-in and -out will reduce the \\nmarket impact of the entry and exit trades. If we want to implement scaling-\\nin using Bollinger bands, we can just have multiple entries and exits: for \\nexample, entryZscore = 1, 2, 3, …, N and exitZscore = 0, 1, 2, …, N − 1. Of \\ncourse, N is another parameter to be optimized using a training data set.\\nAll of these seemed very commonsensical until the research by Schoen-\\nberg and Corwin proved that entering or exiting at two or more Bollinger \\nbands is never optimal; that is, you can always fi  nd a single entry/exit level \\nthat will generate a higher average return in a backtest (Schoenberg and \\nCorwin, 2010). They call this optimal single entry method “all-in.”\\nT o illustrate their point, let’s say a future contract has recently dropped to \\na price L1, and you expect it to revert to a higher fi  nal price F > L1 (we have \\nto assume mean reversion to compare averaging-in versus all-in), though \\nthere is a probability p that the price will go lower to L2 < L1 before re-\\nbounding to F. These possibilities are illustrated in Figure 3.4. W e have just \\nenough buying power to invest in a total of two contracts, whether at prices \\nL1, L2, or F.

If p = 1, method II is the \\nmost profi  table. In fact, there is a transition probability pˆ = (F − L1) / (F − L2) \\nsuch that if p < pˆ, method I is more profi  table than II, and vice versa if p > pˆ. \\nIt is also easy to show that if p < pˆ, method I is also more profi  table than III, \\nand if p > pˆ, method II is more profi  table than III. So there is no situation \\nwhere the average-in strategy is the most profi  table one!\\nSo does that mean the whole idea of scaling-in/averaging-in has been \\ndebunked? Not necessarily.

In all the mean-reverting strategies we have discussed so far, we \\njust took a moving look-back period and computed the regression coeffi  cient \\nor Johansen eigenvector over data in that period only. This has the disadvan-\\ntage that if the look-back period is short, the deletion of the earliest bar and \\nthe inclusion of the latest bar as time moves forward can have an abrupt and \\nartifi  cial impact on the hedge ratio. W e face the same problem if we use mov-\\ning averages or moving standard deviations to calculate the current mean and \\nstandard deviation of a price series. In all cases, we may be able to improve \\nthe estimate by using a weighting scheme that gives more weight to the latest \\ndata, and less weight to the earlier data, without an arbitrary cutoff   point. The \\nfamiliar exponential moving average (EMA) is one such weighting scheme, \\nbut it is not clear why an exponential decrease in weights is optimal either. \\nHere, we will describe a scheme of updating the hedge ratio using the Kal-\\nman fi  lter that avoids the problem of picking a weighting scheme arbitrarily \\n(Montana, Triantafyllopoulos, and Tsagaris, 2009). \\nKalman fi  lter is an optimal linear algorithm that updates the expected \\nvalue of a hidden variable based on the latest value of an observable variable. \\n(For a good exposition of this topic, see Kleeman, 2007.) It is linear because \\nit assumes that the observable variable is a linear function of the hidden \\nvariable with noise. It also assumes the hidden variable at time t is a linear \\nfunction of itself at time t − 1 with noise, and that the noises present in these \\nfunctions have Gaussian distributions (and hence can be specifi  ed with an \\nevolving covariance matrix, assuming their means to be zero.) Because of \\nall these linear relations, the expected value of the hidden variable at time \\nt is also a linear function of its expected value prior to the observation at \\nt, as well as a linear function of the value of the observed variable at t. The \\nKalman fi  lter is optimal in the sense that it is the best estimator available if \\nwe assume that the noises are Gaussian, and it minimizes the mean square \\nerror of the estimated variables. \\nFor every application of Kalman fi  ltering, we need to fi  rst fi  gure out what \\nthese variables and matrices are:\\n ■ Observable variable (vector)\\n ■ Hidden variable (vector)\\n ■ State transition model (matrix)\\n ■ Observation model (matrix)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='452c8de7-0a31-4ceb-925f-d91460612522', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '76', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='76\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nThis is actually the only creative part of the application because once these \\nquantities are specifi  ed, the rest is just a robotic application of an existing \\nalgorithm.

The linear function that \\nrelates y and β is, of course, \\n y (t) = x(t) β(t) + ∋(t),  (“Measurement equation”) (3.5)\\nwhere x is the price series of the other asset, and ∋ is a Gaussian noise with \\nvariance V ∋. As we typically allow the spread between x and y to have a \\nnonzero mean, we will use a 2 × 1 vector β to denote both the intercept μ \\nand the slope of the linear relation between x and y, and we will augment \\nx(t) with a column vector of ones to create an N × 2 array to allow for the \\nconstant off  set between x and y. x actually serves as the observation model in \\nthe Kalman fi  lter lingo.\\nIt may seem strange that we regard only y(t) as an observable but not x(t), \\nbut this is just a mathematical trick, as every variable in the Kalman fi  lter \\nequations is observable except for the hidden variable and the noises, and so \\nwe have the freedom to designate which variable is the “observable” (y) and \\nwhich one is the “observation model” (x).

Because this is a favorite \\nmodel for market makers to update their estimate of the mean price of an \\nasset, as Euan Sinclair pointed out (Sinclair, 2010). T o make these equations \\nmore practical, practitioners make further assumptions about the measure-\\nment error Ve, which, as you may recall, measures the uncertainty of the ob-\\nserved transaction price. But how can there be uncertainty in the observed \\ntransaction price? It turns out that we can interpret the uncertainty in such \\na way that if the trade size is large (compared to some benchmark), then the \\nuncertainty is small, and vice versa. So Ve in this case becomes a function of t \\nas well. If we denote the trade size as T and the benchmark trade size as Tmax, \\nthen Ve can have the form\\n V e = R(t | t − 1) −\\n⎛\\n⎝\\n⎜\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n⎟T\\nT 1\\nmax\\n (3.20)\\nSo you can see that if T = Tmax, there is no uncertainty in the observed \\nprice, and the Kalman gain is 1, and hence the new estimate of the mean \\nprice m(t) is exactly equal to the observed price! But what should  Tmax be? It \\ncan be some fraction of the total trading volume of the previous day, for ex-\\nample, where the exact fraction is to be optimized with some training data.\\nNote the similarity of this approach to the so-called volume-weighted \\naverage price (VWAP) approach to determine the mean price, or fair value \\nof an asset. In the Kalman fi  lter approach, not only are we giving more \\nweights to trades with larger trade sizes, we are also giving more weights to \\nmore recent trade prices. So one might compare this to volume and time-\\nweighted average price.\\n ■ The Danger of Data Errors\\nData errors have a particularly insidious eff  ect on both backtesting and ex-\\necuting mean-reverting strategies. \\nIf there are errors, or “outliers,” in the historical data used for back-\\ntesting, then these errors usually infl  ate the backtest performance of \\nmean-reverting strategies. For example, if the actual trade prices of a \\nstock at 11:00, 11:01, and 11:02 were $100, $100, and $100, but the \\nhistorical data erroneously recorded them as $100, $110, $100, then \\nyour mean-reverting strategy’s backtest is likely to have shorted the \\nstock at 11:01 ($110), and then covered the position at 11:02 ($100) \\nand made a tidy but fi  ctitious profi  t of $10.

That’s why reputable data \\nvendors took great care in incorporating the exchange-provided cancel-\\nand-correct codes to correct any trades that may have been canceled due \\nto transaction prices that are too far from “normal.” (What constitutes a \\n“normal” price is solely determined, sometimes on a case-by-case basis, \\nby the relevant exchange.) Thomas Falkenberry (2002) has written more \\non data cleansing issues.\\nHowever, this type of data error will suppress the backtest performance \\nof momentum strategies, so it is not as dangerous. In the preceding ex-\\nample, a momentum strategy will likely buy the stock at 11:01 ($110) in \\nbacktest, and may be stopped out at a loss at 11:02 ($100).\\nThe same kind of errors will, of course, trigger wrong trades in live trad-\\ning as well, often resulting in real-life losses. In the preceding example, if the \\nprices were bid prices, and we have the erroneous bid at $110 at 11:02, then \\nour execution program may have sent a short market sell order at that time, \\nwhich unfortunately will be fi  lled at $100 instead since there was actually \\nno bid at $110. \\nThis problem with erroneous live bid/ask quotes is particularly dan-\\ngerous when trading pairs or other arbitrage strategies, because in these \\nstrategies we often depend on the diff  erences of the price quotes from \\nvarious instruments to trigger trading signals. The diff  erence of a pair of \\nquotes is usually of much smaller magnitude than the quotes themselves, \\nso any error in the quotes results in a much bigger percentage error in the \\nspread. For example, if we are trading a pair of stocks X and  Y , and X has \\na true bid price of $100 and Y has a true ask price of $105, so the spread \\nY−X is $5, which may be too small to trigger an market order to buy X \\nand sell Y . But if data error causes Y to display an ask price of $106, then \\nthe erroneous spread becomes $6, an increase of 20 percent over the real \\nspread of $5, and this may be enough to trigger an erroneous order to buy \\nX and sell Y .\\nI have seen this problem in live trading when I used a broker’s data feed \\nto drive an equities pair-trading strategy. That data feed quite regularly trig-\\ngered losing trades that I could not explain, until I switched the data feed \\nto a third-party provider (nothing fancier than Yahoo! real-time quotes) and \\nthe bad trades stopped. Later on, I had access to Bloomberg’s live data feed, \\nand it didn’t trigger any of these bad trades either.\\nBad ticks in live data will also cause momentum strategies to send \\nwrong orders.

In theory, \\nwe can form pairs of stocks belonging to any sector and expect them to \\ncointegrate due to their exposure to many common economic factors. Their \\nnumber is large, so diversifi  cation is easy. In practice, though, there are some \\nserious diffi  culties with applying these generic techniques to trading stocks \\nand ETFs. This chapter will examine issues specifi  c to stocks and ETFs.

W e fi  nd that \\nin the short term, most stocks exhibit mean-reverting properties under \\nnormal circumstances. (Normal circumstance means there isn’t any news \\non the stock, a topic that is taken up in Chapter 7.) This is despite the \\nfact that stock prices follow geometric random walks over the long term. \\nW e will build a strategy to exploit this short-term, or “seasonal,” mean \\nreversion.\\nIndex arbitrage is another familiar mean reversion strategy.

Because little profit is left using the traditional \\nimplementation of index arbitrage, we give an example of a modified \\nstrategy.\\nAs mentioned before, in addition to the familiar time series mean \\nreversion to which we have devoted all our attention so far, there is the \\nphenomenon of cross-sectional mean reversion, which is prevalent in \\nbaskets of stocks. Recall that in time series mean reversion, the prices \\nare reverting to a mean determined by their own historical prices, while \\ncross-sectional mean reversion means that the cumulative returns of the \\ninstruments in a basket will revert to the cumulative return of the bas-\\nket. The statistical tests for time series mean reversion are largely irrel-\\nevant for cross-sectional mean reversion. This additional type of mean \\nreversion makes creating any sort of mean-reverting strategy for stocks \\neven easier.\\n Because of this ease of fi  nding mean-reverting patterns, the stock market \\nattracts a large number of traders, often called statistical arbitrageurs, to ex-\\nploit such patterns. As a result, the returns in such strategies have generally \\ndecreased. W e discuss a few simple tricks that can boost their otherwise \\ndeclining performances.\\nOnce again, we emphasize that the backtesting results in this book \\ndo not include transaction costs. One reason for this omission is that \\ntransaction costs can depend quite sensitively on the exact execution \\nmethod used and the exact stock universe chosen for the stock models. \\nA more specific pitfall included in the backtesting of the stock models \\nis the use of data with survivorship bias, since survivorship bias-free \\ndata is more cumbersome and expensive to assemble. The hope is that \\nthe results are not too unrealistic, at least for results in the past year \\nor two. If you intend to redo the backtests with survivorship bias–free \\ndatabases, you should remember that the chosen stock index (typically \\nStandard & Poor’s [S&P] 500) has a changing composition throughout \\nits history, too. T o do this properly, you would need a database contain-\\ning the historical daily index compositions. Remember also the issue of \\nprimary versus consolidated stock prices discussed in Chapter 1. The \\nhistorical prices used here are all consolidated opens and closes. But if \\nyou implement some of these strategies using market-on-open (MOO) \\nor limit-on-open (LOO) orders, or similarly market-on-close (MOC) \\nor limit-on-close (LOC) orders, you will be filled at the primary ex-\\nchange open or close.

Y et nowadays it can be surprisingly diffi  cult to \\nsqueeze profi  ts out of it.\\nIf we test the daily price series of individual stocks, they almost never \\nmeet the defi  nition of stationarity as defi  ned in Chapter 2. The geometric \\nrandom walk describes their behaviors fairly well: once they walked away, \\nthey seldom returned to their starting points. (Their intraday and seasonal \\nmean-reverting properties are special cases to be discussed later on.)\\nEven if you pair them up in some sensible way (e.g., Exxon versus Chev-\\nron, or Citibank versus Bank of America), they are seldom cointegrating out-of-\\nsample. I emphasize out-of-sample because it is quite easy to fi  nd cointegrating \\nstock pairs in any chosen period of time, but they can just as easily lose cointe-\\ngration in the subsequent out-of-sample period. The reason for this diffi  culty \\nis that the fortunes of one company can change very quickly depending on \\nmanagement decisions and the competition. The fact that two companies are in \\nthe same industry sector does not guarantee that they will be subjected to the \\nsame fortune (think AAPL versus BBRY). The upshot is that it is diffi  cult to be \\nconsistently profi  table in trading a single pair of stocks using a mean-reverting \\nstrategy unless you have a fundamental understanding of each of the companies \\nand can exit a position in time before bad news on one of them becomes public. \\nWhat if we trade a large number of pairs of stocks, so that occasional de-\\nrailment of some pairs would not aff  ect the profi  tability of the entire port-\\nfolio? The law of large numbers will only work in our favor if the expected \\nreturn of an individual pair in the out-of-sample period is positive, but I have \\nnot found this to be the case for stock pairs. Apparently, the small profi  ts \\ngained by the “good” pairs have been completely overwhelmed by the large \\nlosses of the pairs that have gone “bad.”\\nOther than these fundamental problems with stock pairs trading, there \\nare two additional technical diffi  culties. \\nThe fi  rst diffi  culty is short-sale constraint. It is particularly dangerous for \\na stock pair that involves shorting a hard-to-borrow stock, because even if \\nyour position is ultimately profi  table, you may be forced to liquidate it at \\nthe most unprofi  table and inopportune time. This may happen when you are \\nshort this stock and it suddenly jumps up in value due to some unexpected \\ngood news, and many lenders of this stock are eager to sell them. In this \\ncase, your borrowed stock may be recalled, and you will be forced to buy ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='20d4e6fc-def4-4ccc-994e-438f0f09b019', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '90', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='90\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nto cover this position at a big loss, while selling the long position on the \\nother leg. This is called the short squeeze.\\nUnder the same heading of short-sale constraint, the new alternative uptick \\nrule in eff  ect in the U.S. stock markets since 2010 also creates uncertainty in \\nboth backtesting and live executions of stock pairs strategy. Once the circuit \\nbreaker is triggered, we are essentially forbidden to send short market orders.\\nThe second diffi  culty arises in the intraday trading of stock pairs. Since the \\nprofi  t margins in stock pairs trading have been decreasing through the years, \\nit becomes imperative to enter and exit positions intraday to capture the best \\nprices. Also, if traders refrain from taking overnight positions in stock pairs, \\nthey may be able to avoid the changes in fundamental corporate valuations \\nthat plague longer-term positions mentioned above. However, intraday pair \\ntrading of stocks runs into the problem that the national best bid and off  er \\n(NBBO) quote sizes for stocks (and for ETFs) have become very small. This \\nmay be due to the prevalence of using dark pools or undisplayed “iceberg” \\norders by institutional traders, the breaking up of large orders into very small \\nchild orders by smart execution algorithms, the advent of high-frequency \\ntraders submitting small orders that they can cancel and replace frequently, \\nand, fi  nally, the reluctance of market makers to display large order sizes to \\navoid being taken advantage of by high-frequency traders.\\nFor example, it is not unusual for AAPL to have an NBBO size of just \\n100 shares! Therefore, backtesting a stock pair–trading strategy using either \\ntrade or quote prices is not very realistic unless you trade only 100 shares \\nor if you include a substantial transaction cost. The same phenomenon leads \\nto diffi  culties in live execution also. If we were to submit market orders for \\nboth sides after a trading signal was triggered by the NBBO prices, we could \\nhave suff  ered a substantial slippage. W e are forced to send limit orders for \\none side (or for both sides with small fractions of an order and suff  er tem-\\nporary small unhedged positions) and actively manage the possible cancella-\\ntions and resubmissions of this order in case they are not fully fi  lled.\\nWhy was pair trading stocks so profi  table in the past? One general reason \\nis that the market was much more ineffi  cient back then, so the normal profi  ts \\nfrom the pairs that do mean-revert are large enough to cover those losses from \\npairs that don’t. This is, of course, a common plague for any profi  table strate-\\ngies, but it is particularly acute for such well-known strategies as pair trading \\nof stocks. One specifi  c reason for the decline in profi  ts of stock pairs trading is \\nthe decimalization of U.S. stock prices. Decimalization caused bid-ask spreads \\nto dramatically narrow , so pair traders, who act as a type of market makers, \\nfi  nd that their market-making profi  ts decrease also (Serge, 2008).

But for the U.S. market, we have the alternative of profi  t-\\nably pair trading ETFs instead.\\n ■ Trading ETF Pairs (and Triplets)\\nThe one advantage of trading ETF pairs instead of stock pairs is that, once \\nfound to be cointegrating, ETF pairs are less likely to fall apart in out-\\nof-sample data. That is because the fundamental economics of a basket of \\nstocks changes much more slowly than that of a single company. For ex-\\nample, since both Australia and Canada are commodity-based economies, \\nEWA and EWC (their respective stock index ETFs) are good candidates \\nfor cointegration tests. And, indeed, we confi  rmed their cointegration in \\nChapter 3. I mentioned this pair back in 2009 on my blog (http://epchan\\n.blogspot.com/2009/11/in-praise-of-etfs.html?showComment =125743\\n4002472#c1235760260813269054), and their cointegration continues as \\nof this writing (November 2012). The pair selection process for ETFs is \\nquite easy: we need to fi  nd ETFs that are exposed to common econom-\\nic factors. Besides country ETFs, sector ETFs are another fertile ground \\nfor fi  nding cointegrated instruments. For example, the retail fund RTH \\ncointegrates with the consumer staples fund XLP . With the proliferation of \\nETFs tracking more or less the same sector, pair-trading opportunities are \\nsteadily increasing.\\nAnother favorite ETF pairing of mine is between a commodity ETF and \\nan ETF of companies that produce that commodity. The gold fund GLD \\nversus the gold miners fund GDX is a good example. The rationale is that \\nsince the main asset of a gold-mining company is gold, their values should \\ncointegrate with gold spot prices. And, indeed, they have done so—until \\nJuly 14, 2008, or thereabout. If we test for cointegration of GLD versus \\nGDX between May 23, 2006, and July 14, 2008, using the Johansen test, \\nwe fi  nd that they cointegrate with 99 percent probability, but if we test over \\nthe period July 15, 2008, to April 9, 2012, they have lost the cointegration. \\nWhat happened on July 14, 2008? That’s when oil (the W est T exas Interme-\\ndiate fl  avor) price peaked at around $145 per barrel, an all-time high.

When scientists fi  rst come upon \\nan unexplained phenomenon, they form a hunch about its cause, and then \\nthey fi  nd ways to test this hunch empirically. W e should adopt the same \\nscientifi  c process in approaching trading. When a trading strategy stops \\nworking, we should form a hypothesis of the reason, and then test empiri-\\ncally whether that hypothesis is supported by data. The outcome of this pro-\\ncess is often a modifi  ed strategy that regains profi  tability.\\nOne might think that the oil fund USO versus the energy sector fund \\nXLE is another example of a commodity versus commodity producer pair, \\nbut there is a problem with this pairing. While GLD owns gold, and thus \\nrefl  ects the gold spot price, USO doesn’t actually own oil. It invests in oil \\nfutures contracts. As we will discuss in Chapter 5, futures price of a com-\\nmodity diff  ers from its spot price. Even if XLE cointegrates with the spot \\nprice of oil, it may not necessarily cointegrate with USO. Of course, this \\nproblem plagues any commodity futures fund versus commodity producer \\nfund. Mean reversion trading of such pairs would be much less risky if the \\ncommodity fund holds the actual commodity rather than the futures.\\nThe mechanics of trading ETF pairs is the same as trading stock pairs. The \\nold uptick rule exempted ETFs, but the new alternative uptick rule covers \\nall securities traded on U.S. stock exchanges. However, the NBBO sizes for \\nETFs are certainly much larger than that for stocks. For example, on a typi-\\ncal day, the NBBO sizes for EWC can be around 5,000 shares.\\n ■ Intraday Mean Reversion: Buy-on-Gap Model\\nStock prices follow geometric random walks, as many fi  nancial scholars \\nhave tirelessly reminded us (Malkiel, 2008).

Our job as traders is to fi  nd special conditions, or \\nspecial periods, such that mean reversion occurs with regularity, while at \\nthe same time avoiding data-snooping bias. As the following strategy will \\nshow , there may indeed be seasonal mean reversion occurring at the intraday \\ntime frame even for stocks.\\nThe rules for the strategy are:\\n 1. Select all stocks near the market open whose returns from their \\nprevious day’s lows to today’s opens are lower than one standard \\ndeviation. The standard deviation is computed using the daily close-\\nto-close returns of the last 90 days. These are the stocks that “gapped \\ndown.” \\n 2. Narrow down this list of stocks by requiring their open prices to be \\nhigher than the 20-day moving average of the closing prices. \\n 3. Buy the 10 stocks within this list that have the lowest returns from their \\nprevious day’s lows. If the list has fewer than 10 stocks, then buy the \\nentire list.\\n 4. Liquidate all positions at the market close.\\nThe rationale for this strategy is that on days when the stock index futures \\nare down before the open, certain stocks suff  er disproportionately due to \\npanic selling at the open. But once this panic selling is over, the stock will \\ngradually appreciate over the course of the day.\\nRule 2 is often very useful in mean-reverting strategies: it is basically a \\nmomentum fi  lter superimposed on a mean-reverting strategy, a technique \\nthat we will reprise often. Usually, those stocks that dropped “just a little” \\nhave a better chance of reversal than those that dropped “a lot” because the \\nlatter are often the ones that have negative news such as poor earnings an-\\nnouncements. Drops caused by negative news are less likely to revert. W e \\ncan actually develop momentum strategies based on such breaking news \\n(more on this in Chapter 7). Furthermore, the fact that a stock is higher \\nthan a long-term moving average attracts selling pressure from larger play-\\ners such as long-only funds, whose trading horizons tend to be longer. This \\ndemand for liquidity at the open may exaggerate the downward pressure \\non the price, but price moves due to liquidity demands are more likely to \\nrevert when such demands vanish than price moves due to a shift in the \\nfundamental economics of the stock. Therefore, this strategy can succeed \\nin a news-heavy environment where traditional interday stock pairs trading \\nwill likely fail.\\nThe MATLAB code to backtest this strategy is displayed in Example 4.1.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7f412ac3-7a13-4dce-a4d5-2b5740b56547', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '94', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='94\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nThis strategy has an annual percentage rate (APR) of 8.7 percent and a \\nSharpe ratio of 1.5 from May 11, 2006, to April 24, 2012.

If the stocks are \\nweighted in the same way used to construct the index, then the market \\nvalue of the portfolio will cointegrate very tightly with the index fu-\\ntures. Maybe too tightly—unfortunately, this is such a well-known strat-\\negy that the difference in market values has become extremely small \\n(Reverre, 2001). All but the most sophisticated traders can profit from \\nthis strategy, and it most certainly needs to be traded intraday, perhaps \\nat high frequency (see Box 4.1). In order to increase this difference, we \\ncan select only a subset of the stocks in the index to form the portfolio. \\nThe same concept can be applied to the arbitrage between a portfolio \\nFIGURE 4.2 Cumulative Returns of Short-on-Gap Model', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='04f17db6-5f75-4634-8092-d413c0ecb170', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '97', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='97MEAN REVERSION OF STOCKS AND ETFSof stocks constituting an ETF and the ETF itself. In this case, we choose \\njust a proper subset of the constituent stocks to form the portfolio. One \\nselection method is to just pick all the stocks that cointegrate individu-\\nally with the ETF. W e will demonstrate the method by using the most \\nfamous ETF of all: SPY .\\nW e will pick one year of data (in our example, January 1, 2007, to De-\\ncember 31, 2007) as a training set and look for all the stocks that cointe-\\ngrate with SPY with at least 90 percent probability using the Johansen test. \\nThen we form a portfolio of these stocks with equal capital on each stock, \\nand confi  rm using the Johansen test again that this long-only portfolio still \\ncointegrates with SPY . This step is necessary because an arbitrary assign-\\nment of equal capital weight to each stock does not necessarily produce a \\nportfolio price series that cointegrates with that of SPY , even if each of the \\nconstituent stocks is cointegrating with SPY . W e are using log price in this \\nsecond test because we expect to rebalance this portfolio every day so that \\nthe capital on each stock is constant. (See the discussions in Chapter 3.) \\nAfter confi  rming cointegration, we can then backtest the linear mean re-\\nversion strategy described in Chapter 2. The MATLAB source codes are \\ndisplayed in Example 4.2.\\nBOX 4.1\\nHigh-Frequency Index Arbitrage\\nHigh-frequency traders have been able to exploit two defi  ciencies in the \\nintraday computations of the indices and arbitrage between the futures \\ntracking these indices versus the component stocks. The fi  rst defi  ciency is \\nthat many major indices including Dow Jones, S&P , Nasdaq, and Russell \\nare computed using only the primary exchange trades data (see Chapter 1 \\non primary versus consolidated stock prices), which represent less than \\n30 percent of all shares traded on those stocks (Arnuk and Saluzzi, 2012). The \\nsecond defi  ciency is that the index is updated only once every few seconds. \\nBoth defi  ciencies lead to a discrepancy between the true, most up-to-date \\nmarket value of a basket of component stocks and the index value itself. As a \\nresult, the index future value can be expected to lag the instantaneous market \\nvalue of the stocks. If the index future value is higher than the instantaneous \\nmarket value, we can simply short the future and vice versa. Where can we \\nget this true, instantaneous market value of the stocks? We would, of course, \\nneed to subscribe to the direct data feed of every U.S. stock exchange and \\nECN (and not the SIAC feed) and monitor the trade prices for all the stocks \\nin the index with millisecond latency in all these venues.

If a few stocks have to be removed due to the short-sale constraint, \\nthe impact should be limited.\\n ■ Cross-Sectional Mean Reversion: A Linear \\nLong-Short Model\\nIn mean reversion trading based on cointegration, we form a portfolio with \\na fi  xed set of instruments and with either a fi  xed number of shares or a fi  xed \\ndollar capital for each instrument. This fi  xed number may be determined by \\nfi  at (as in Example 4.2), linear regression, the Johansen test, or constrained \\noptimization. But there is no reason why the portfolio has to consist of the \\nsame fi  xed set of instruments or the same weightings over this set of in-\\nstruments every day. For many portfolio stock-trading strategies, the edge \\ncomes precisely from the intelligent daily selection or reweighting of stocks. \\nIn this type of so-called “cross-sectional” mean reversion strategy, the in-\\ndividual stock (and this type of strategy most commonly involves stocks, not \\nfutures or currencies) price does not necessarily revert to its own historical \\nmean. Rather, the focus is on their short-term relative returns, and we rely \\non the serial anti-correlation of these relative returns to generate profi  ts. In \\nmost cases, the relative returns are computed as a stock’s return minus the \\naverage returns of all the stocks in a particular universe. So we expect the \\nunderperformance of a stock to be followed by overperformance, and vice \\nversa. Since we are measuring only relative return, it is quite possible that \\nwe will short a stock even though its previous (absolute) return is negative, \\nas long as it is not as negative as the average return across all stocks in the \\nuniverse.\\nOne interesting feature of cross-sectional strategies is that, in contrast to \\n“time series” strategies, we should not expect profi  ts from every individual \\nstock, as some of them may serve as “hedges” on some days. Rather, profi  ts \\ncan be obtained only in the aggregate across all the stocks.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='6f76e0e5-8b59-48ea-a8d0-ea198373a2c4', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '103', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='103MEAN REVERSION OF STOCKS AND ETFS\\nI described in my previous book just such a strategy proposed by Khan-\\ndani and Lo (Example 3.7 of Chan, 2009; original paper is Khandani and Lo, \\n2007). With this strategy, we invest in every stock from some favorite index \\nsuch as S&P 500, S&P 1500, or Russell 2000, but with diff  erent capital al-\\nlocation per stock. Near the market close of each day, we will determine the \\nlong or short capital wi allocated to the ith stock as\\n w i = −(ri − 〈rj〉)/ ∑k |rk − 〈rj〉| (4.1)\\nwhere ri is the daily return of the ith stock, and 〈rj〉 is the average daily return \\nof all the stocks in the index. In other words, if a stock has a very positive \\nreturn relative to its peers, we will short lots of it, and if it has a very nega-\\ntive return relative to its peers, we will buy lots of it. Note that we always \\ninvest the same total gross capital of $1 to the portfolio every day because of \\nthe normalization factor in the denominator.

Furthermore, rollover interests might sometimes play an impor-\\ntant role in determining total returns. These nuances will be covered in \\nthis chapter.\\n ■ Trading Currency Cross-Rates\\nThe basic idea in forming a stationary portfolio of foreign currencies is very \\nsimilar to the trading of stock index ETF pairs from diff  erent countries: \\nwe need to fi  nd countries that have similar economic fundamentals. Since \\nwe found, for example, that EWA (Australian stock index ETF) and EWC \\n(Canadian stock index ETF) cointegrate, we might expect to fi  nd AUD \\n(Australian dollar) to cointegrate with CAD (Canadian dollar) as well. In \\naddition, because both Australia and South Africa have major mining rev-\\nenues, we might expect AUD to cointegrate with ZAR (South African rand). \\nIn fact, traders have called these and other currencies such as the Norwegian \\nkrone commodity currencies.\\nTrading currency pairs has a number of advantages compared to trad-\\ning their corresponding stock index ETF pairs. Usually, liquidity in curren-\\ncies is higher (especially for best bid/ask sizes), thus lowering transaction \\ncosts. The leverage that can be employed for currencies is also much higher, \\nthough this can be a double-edged sword of course. There are no short-sale \\nconstraints for currencies. Finally, currency trading can be done around the \\nclock, at least fi  ve days a week from 5:00 p .m. ET on Sunday to 5:00 p .m. \\nET on Friday. (ET can be either EDT or EST; i.e., it is either GMT -4 or \\nGMT -5.) This means that we have a lot more trading opportunities in cur-\\nrencies, and we can also employ stop losses in a meaningful way. (If a market \\nis closed for a long period, stop losses are useless as the market can gap up \\nor down when it reopens.)\\nDespite the conceptual similarity with trading ETF pairs, the mechanics \\nof currency trading is quite diff  erent. Let’s start with some basic terminol-\\nogy. If we are trading the cross-rate AUD.ZAR, then AUD is called the base \\ncurrency, and ZAR is the quote currency. (My personal mnemonic for this: \\nB is ahead of Q alphabetically, so the order is B.Q.) If AUD.ZAR is quoted \\nat 9.58, it takes 9.58 South African rand to buy 1 Australian dollar. Buying \\n100,000 AUD.ZAR means buying 100,000 Australian dollars, while sell-\\ning the equivalent amount (100,000 × 9.58 = 958,000 at the preceding \\nquote) of South African rand. However, few brokers actually off  er AUD.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e5cbf24d-b027-4181-94cb-6fffe8a959fa', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '109', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='109MEAN REVERSION OF CURRENCIES AND FUTURES\\nZAR as a cross-rate. So usually we have to buy X units of B.ZAR and sell X \\nunits of B.AUD to eff  ectively buy X Australian dollar worth of AUD.ZAR, \\nwhere B is some other base currency. W e usually choose a very liquid base \\ncurrency such as USD or EUR for this operation. W e can denote such a \\nsynthetic pair as USD.ZAR/USD.AUD, since the quote of AUD.ZAR will \\nbe exactly equal to this ratio of quotes. When we actually trade this syn-\\nthetic pair live, the realized profi  t and loss (P&L) will be denominated in \\nboth ZAR and AUD. In general, when we compute the returns of a strat-\\negy trading B.Q, we are assuming that the profi  ts are denominated in our \\nlocal currency (USD for U.S. investors), which may be neither B nor Q. So \\nin order for our actual realized P&L to conform to our backtest P&L, we \\nneed to regularly convert B and Q into our local currency. For example, if \\nour local currency is USD, and we have realized profi  ts of X units of AUD \\nand Y units of ZAR after a round trip trade, we need to buy X units of \\nZAR.USD and Y units of ZAR.AUD. If we don’t do this regularly, a large \\naccumulated P&L in AUD and ZAR may cause signifi  cant deviation from \\nour backtest results.\\nEven when a cross-rate such as AUD.CAD is ready-made for trading, we \\nmay sometimes fi  nd it advantageous to weigh the two currencies diff  erently \\nby trading AUD.USD versus USD.CAD separately. The code in Example 5.1 \\nillustrates such a strategy. In this strategy we use the Johansen test to fi  nd out \\nthe best hedge ratio of capital, or capital weights, between AUD.USD versus \\nCAD.USD. Why not use the conventional quote USD.CAD instead of CAD.\\nUSD? That’s because in order to interpret the eigenvector from the Johan-\\nsen test as capital weights, the two price series must have the same quote \\ncurrency. Otherwise, the point moves of the two presumptive cointegrating \\ninstruments would not have the same value, rendering the Johansen test \\nmeaningless. Using CAD.USD in our backtest program doesn’t make live \\ntrading any more diffi  cult: Whenever the program sends an order to “Buy 1 \\nunit of CAD.USD,” we should just “Sell 1/y of USD.CAD,” provided y is the \\ncurrent quote for USD.CAD.\\nIn Example 5.1, we focus on trading two currencies that can ultimate-\\nly be reduced to a pair with a common quote currency USD: B 1.USD −\\nB2.USD.

Note that “overnight” in \\ncurrency trading means holding a position untill or beyond 5:00 p .m. ET . If \\nwe are long a pair B.Q overnight, the interest diff  erential is iB − iQ, where iB \\nand iQ are the daily interest rates of currency B and Q, respectively. If iQ > \\niB, then this interest diff  erential, also called a rollover interest, is actually a \\ndebit interest (i.e., your account will be debited). Actually, for reasons that \\nhave to do with the T + 2 day settlement system, if a position was held past \\nthe 5 p .m. ET close on day T , and day T + 3 is a weekend or holiday for either \\ncurrency of the cross-rate, the rollover interest accrued on that position will \\nbe multiplied by one plus the number of days the market remains closed. So \\nif a position was held past 5 p .m. ET on W ednesday, the rollover interest is \\nthree times the daily rate since the market is closed on Saturday and Sunday. \\nA further exception to this rule applies when we are trading USD.CAD or \\nUSD.MXN, where the settlement occurs on day T + 1, so we only multiply \\nthe rollover interest by one plus the number of nontrading days if day T + 2 \\nis a weekend or holiday. (Thus, only if a position was held past 5:00 p .m. ET \\non Thursday will the rollover interest be three times the daily rate.) All these \\nconsiderations impinge on the accuracy of a backtest of strategies that hold \\novernight positions.\\nWhen we calculate the Sharpe ratio for any strategy, we need to calculate \\nthe excess return, because the Sharpe ratio is the ratio of the average excess \\nreturn divided by the standard deviation of the excess returns, suitably an-\\nnualized. The excess return is the return of the positions that the strategy \\nholds minus the fi  nancing cost of those positions. So if we have only intraday \\npositions, the fi  nancing cost is zero. If we are trading a long-short dollar \\nneutral equity portfolio, we can assume the fi  nancing cost is close to zero, \\neven though the credit interest is usually slightly less than the absolute value \\nof the debit interest. For futures positions, the fi  nancing cost is also zero, \\nbecause futures positions are just contracts, not assets that require cash to \\nfi  nance. (W e do not count the margin cash requirement, since that cash gen-\\nerates interest in the account.)

He and \\nJohn Hicks argued that for normal commodities, those who actually own \\nthe physical commodities (the “hedgers,” such as farmers or oil producers) \\ntend to hedge their positions by shorting futures, expecting to lose money \\non their hedges. Meanwhile, the speculators are the ones who have a net \\nlong position, and need to be compensated for taking this risk. So they will \\nbuy only futures with positive roll return, or equivalently futures that have \\nlower prices than the expected future spot price; that is, the ones in “normal \\nbackwardation.” So we should remember that “backwardation” is always \\nassociated with “normal,” and “normal” means the futures price is always \\nlower than the spot price.\\n Of course, this argument is not completely correct, since we will see that \\ncrude oil, a perfectly “normal” commodity, is in contango over various periods. \\nBut this story gives us a good mnemonic.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7fb218bc-d94b-433e-b75d-8c0e48d6d7fc', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '118', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='118\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nT o calculate the spot and roll returns for a set of futures contracts, it is \\nhelpful to have a simple model of futures prices. For many commodities, we \\ncan write \\n F(t, T  ) = S(t)exp(γ(t − T  )) (5.7)\\nwhere t is the current time, T is the expiration time, and S(t) is the spot \\nprice (Hull, 1997). This model implies that the (compounded) roll return \\nγ is constant over time. But we can take a step further, and assume that the \\n(compounded) spot return α is also constant:\\n S(t) = c eαt (5.8)\\nEssentially, we want to mathematically describe those lines in Figures 5.2 \\nand 5.3, with the slight modifi  cation that they terminate not on a horizontal \\nline, but one that has a nonzero slope. So the model we adopt for the price \\nof a future that matures at time T is \\n F(t, T  ) = c eαtexp(γ(t − T  )) (5.9)\\nwhere c, α, and γ are constants. The total return of a contract is given by \\n ∂(log F(t, T  ))/∂t = α + γ (5.10)\\nsince T is fi  xed for a specifi  c contract.

Y ou might think, then, that trading VX \\nfutures would be a great mean-reverting strategy. (VX is the future that \\ntracks the VIX volatility index trading on the CBOE’s Futures Exchange \\n[CFE].) However, a look at the back-adjusted front-month futures prices \\nover time indicates that the mean reversion in VX only happens after vola-\\ntility peaked around November 20, 2008 (the credit crisis), May 20, 2010 \\n(aftermath of fl  ash crash), and then again on October 3, 2011. At other \\ntimes, it just inexorably declines. Indeed, the ADF test shows that the \\nback-adjusted front contract prices defi  nitively do not mean-revert. Y ou \\ncan see the diff  erence between VIX and the front-month VX in Figure 5.6, \\na diff  erence that is entirely due to roll return.

Based on our previous experience \\nwith spreads in general, calendar spreads would seem to be great candidates \\nfor mean reversion: Aren’t both legs tracking the exact same underlying as-\\nset? But here again, roll returns derail our intuition. The futures price model \\nexpressed in Equation 5.7 will make this clear. \\nAs with any spread trading, we can choose to defi  ne the spread as the \\ndiff  erences of log prices of the two legs in order to generate trading signals \\n(see Chapter 3), assuming that we maintain the market value of the two legs \\nto be the same at every period. The log market value of a spread portfolio \\nwith a long far contract and a short near contract is simply γ(T1 − T2) with \\nT2 > T1, according to Equation 5.7. (Again, this simple formula may not \\nhold if T2 − T1 is large.) The important point is that the calendar spread trad-\\ning signal does not depend at all on the spot price, only on the roll return!\\nAs we learned in Chapter 2, return series (as opposed to price series) \\nalmost always mean-revert. Here we are considering not the total return \\nof a future, but the roll return component only, so things may be diff  erent. \\n(Though the model expressed in Equation 5.7 presupposes that the spot \\nand roll returns are both constant, we may nevertheless attempt to apply it \\nto situations where the roll return varies slowly.) W e run the ADF test for \\n12-month log calendar spread of CL, and discovered that it is indeed station-\\nary with 99 percent probability, and a half-life of 36 days. Furthermore, if \\nwe apply our usual linear mean-reverting strategy to the log calendar spread \\nfor CL, we do get an APR of 8.3 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 1.3 from \\nJanuary 2, 2008, to August 13, 2012.

Nevertheless, let’s systematically round up some of the \\nusual suspects.\\nThe most obvious candidate for pair trading futures is intermarket spreads \\nbetween markets that are closely related. For example, the energy com-\\nplexes (WTI crude oil CL, Brent crude oil BZ, unleaded gasoline RB, and \\nheating oil HO, all traded on the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange [NYMEX]) \\nshould off  er rich potential opportunities. \\nFIGURE 5.8 Cumulative Returns of Linear Mean \\nReversion Strategy on VX Calendar Spread', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='6608d20f-1f7c-46f4-bd95-1ca4ae1e7255', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '128', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='128\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nBefore we run a Johansen test on these four contracts, we can fi  rst ex-\\namine a well-known portfolio called the crack spread consisting of long three \\ncontracts of CL, short two contracts of RB, and short one contract of HO. \\nThis is called the crack spread because we can obtain gasoline and heating \\noil by cracking the long hydrocarbon chains of crude oil molecules, and \\nthe 3:2:1 hedge ratios come about because three barrels of CL produces \\napproximately two barrels of RB and one barrel of heating oil, though this \\nis not universally true for all refi  ners. One advantage of trading the crack \\nspread is that NYMEX off  ers a ready-made basket for it, with a much lower \\nmargin requirement than if we trade them separately. \\nHowever, running an ADF test on the crack spread from May 20, 2002, \\nto May 4, 2012, shows that this spread is not mean reverting. The chart of \\nthis spread (Figure 5.9) reveals a dramatic increase in value around March 9, \\n2007, to July 3, 2008, and then a sharp drop after that, and running the \\nlinear mean reversion strategy on it shows negative returns for that period. \\n(Note that we must back-adjust the continuous contracts using prices rather \\nthan returns in this test; otherwise, this price spread will show a discontinu-\\nous jump at rollovers, as explained in Chapter 1.)\\nAnother spread that would seem to be a good candidate is CL and BZ in a \\n1:1 ratio. After all, their underlyings are both crude oils. But another quick \\nADF test will show that it is far from stationary. BZ has relentlessly outper-\\nformed CL due to a variety of factors. The likely culprits include the in-\\ncreasing oil production in the United States (Friedman, 2012), the pipeline \\nbottleneck at Cushing, Oklahoma (Philips, 2012), and geopolitical concerns \\nFIGURE 5.9 The Crack Spread', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2c40a52f-5f82-40a8-a82a-3c0da945a11d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '129', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='129MEAN REVERSION OF CURRENCIES AND FUTURES\\nsuch as the embargo against Iranian oil in 2012, which aff  ected Europe and \\ntherefore BZ more than the United States.\\nIf you want to backtest intermarket spreads yourself, don’t forget to \\nmake sure that their prices are synchronous, as I cautioned in Chapter 1. In \\nparticular, before BZ started trading at the NYMEX on September 5, 2001, \\nit was traded at the Intercontinental Petroleum Exchange in London, which \\nobviously has a diff  erent closing time than NYMEX on which CL has always \\nbeen traded.

Also, we often need to multiply the \\nfutures prices by a factor to convert points into USD.\\nOur search for mean-reverting intermarket futures spreads has not been \\nfruitful so far. But I will now discuss one unusual spread that will change that.\\nV olatility Futures versus Equity Index Futures\\nMany traders have observed that volatility is anti-correlated with the stock \\nequity market index: When the market goes down, volatility shoots up, and \\nto a lesser extent, vice versa.

So we need to multiply the prices of VX by 1,000 and the prices of ES \\nby 50 in order for the hedge ratio to properly refl  ect the ratio in the number \\nof contracts.\\nThe linear relationship is shown in Equation 5.11.\\n ES × 50 = −0.3906 × VX × 1,000 + $77,150 (5.11)\\nwhere ES and VX are their re spective futures (settlement) prices.

Time series momentum is very simple and in-\\ntuitive: past returns of a price series are positively correlated with future \\nreturns.

W e will examine examples of both types in momentum in futures \\nand stocks. \\nThe strategies I describe in this chapter tend to hold positions for mul-\\ntiple days, which is why I call them “interday” momentum strategies. I will \\nconsider the intraday, higher-frequency momentum strategies in the next \\nchapter. The reason for this distinction is that many interday momentum \\nstrategies suff  er from a recently discovered weakness, while intraday mo-\\nmentum strategies are less aff  ected by it. I will highlight this weakness in \\nthis chapter, and also discuss the very diff  erent properties of momentum \\nstrategies versus their mean-reverting counterparts, as well as their pros \\nand cons.\\n ■ Tests for Time Series Momentum\\nBefore we delve into the diff  erent causes of momentum, we should fi  rst \\nsee how we can measure momentum, or more specifi  cally, time series mo-\\nmentum. Time series momentum of a price series means that past returns \\nare positively correlated with future returns. It follows that we can just \\ncalculate the correlation coeffi  cient of the returns together with its p-value \\n(which represents the probability for the null hypothesis of no correla-\\ntion). One feature of computing the correlation coeffi  cient is that we have \\nto pick a specifi  c time lag for the returns. Sometimes, the most positive \\ncorrelations are between returns of diff  erent lags. For example, 1-day re-\\nturns might show negative correlations, while the correlation between past \\n20-day return with the future 40-day return might be very positive. W e \\nshould fi  nd the optimal pair of past and future periods that gives the highest \\npositive correlation and use that as our look-back and holding period for \\nour momentum strategy. \\nAlternatively, we can also test for the correlations between the signs of \\npast and future returns. This is appropriate when all we want to know is that \\nan up move will be followed by another up move, and we don’t care whether \\nthe magnitudes of the moves are similar.\\nIf we are interested instead in fi  nding out whether there is long-term \\ntrending behavior in the time series without regard to specifi  c time frames, \\nwe can calculate the Hurst exponent together with the Variance Ratio test \\nto rule out the null hypothesis of random walk. These tests were described \\nin Chapter 2 for the detection of mean reversion, but they can just as well \\nbe used as momentum tests.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a6a2a6d4-85fc-4564-b86a-3b222606bf11', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '135', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='135INTERDAY MOMENTUM STRATEGIES\\n I will illustrate the use of these tests below using the two-year Treasury \\nnote future TU trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as an \\nexample.

The top bar represents the data set that forms the \\nfi  rst returns pair, and the second bar from the top represents the data set \\nthat forms the second independent returns pair.

The equity curve also looks quite attractive (see Figure 6.2).\\nThis simple strategy can be applied to all kinds of futures contracts, with \\ndiff  erent optimal look-back periods and the holding days. The results for \\nthree futures we considered are listed in Table 6.2. \\nWhy do many futures returns exhibit serial correlations? And why do \\nthese serial correlations occur only at a fairly long time scale? The expla-\\nnation lies in the roll return component of the total return of futures we \\ndiscussed in Chapter 5. Typically, the sign of roll returns does not vary very \\noften. In other words, the futures stay in contango or backwardation over \\nlong periods of time. The spot returns, however, can vary very rapidly in \\nboth sign and magnitude. So if we hold a future over a long period of time, \\nand if the average roll returns dominate the average total returns, we will \\nfi  nd serial correlation of total returns. This explanation certainly makes \\nsense for BR, HG, and TU, since from Table 5.1 we can see that they all have \\nFIGURE 6.2 Equity Curve of TU Momentum Strategy\\nTABLE 6.2 Time Series Momentum Strategies for Various Futures\\nSymbol Look-back Holding days APR Sharpe ratio Max drawdown\\nBR (CME) 100 10 17.7% 1.09 –14.8%\\nHG (CME) 40 40 18.0% 1.05 –24.0%\\nTU (CBOT) 250 25 1.7% 1.04 –2.5%', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='73d0ede5-9989-4c20-aff6-b6f75779fb7d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '140', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='140\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nroll returns that are bigger in magnitude than their spot returns. (I haven’t \\nfound the reason why it doesn’t work for C, despite its having the largest roll \\nreturn magnitude compared to its average spot return, but maybe you can!)\\nIf we accept the explanation that the time series momentum of futures \\nis due to the persistence of the signs of the roll returns, then we can devise \\na cleaner and potentially better momentum signal than the lagged total re-\\nturn. W e can use the lagged roll return as a signal instead, and go long when \\nthis return is higher than some threshold, go short when this return is lower \\nthan the negative of that threshold, and exit any existing position otherwise. \\nApplying this revised strategy on TU with a threshold of an annualized roll \\nreturn of 3 percent yields a higher APR of 2.5 percent and Sharpe ratio of \\n2.1 from January 2, 2009, to August 13, 2012, with a reduced maximum \\ndrawdown of 1.1 percent.\\nThere are many other possible entry signals besides the simple “sign of re-\\nturn” indicator. For example, we can buy when the price reaches a new N-day \\nhigh, when the price exceeds the N-day moving average or exponential mov-\\ning average, when the price exceeds the upper Bollinger band, or when the \\nnumber of up days exceeds the number of down days in a moving period.\\nThere is also a classic momentum strategy called the Alexander Filter, \\nwhich tells us to buy when the daily return moves up at least x percent, and \\nthen sell and go short if the price moves down at least x percent from a sub-\\nsequent high (Fama and Blume, 1966).\\nSometimes, the combination of mean-reverting and momentum rules may \\nwork better than each strategy by itself. One example strategy on CL is this: \\nbuy at the market close if the price is lower than that of 30 days ago and is high-\\ner than that of 40 days ago; vice versa for shorts. If neither the buy nor the sell \\ncondition is satisfi  ed, fl  atten any existing position. The APR is 12 percent, with \\na Sharpe ratio of 1.1. Adding a mean-reverting fi  lter to the momentum strategy \\nin Example 6.1 will add IBX (MEFF), KT (NYMEX), SXF (DE), US (CBOT), \\nCD (CME), NG (NYMEX), and W (CME) to Table 6.2, and it will also im-\\nprove the returns and Sharpe ratios of the existing contracts in that table.\\nIn fact, if you don’t want to construct your own time series momentum \\nstrategy, there is a ready-made index that is composed of 24 futures: the Stan-\\ndard & Poor’s (S&P) Diversifi  ed Trends Indicator (DTI). The essential strat-\\negy behind this index is that we will long a future if it is above its exponential \\nmoving average, and short it if it is below , with monthly rebalancing. (For \\ndetails, you can visit www .standardandpoors.com.) There is a mutual fund \\n(RYMFX) as well as an exchange-traded fund (WDTI) that tracks this index. \\nMichael Dever computed that the Sharpe ratio of this index was 1.3 with ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cc692ce1-f46b-4c74-b2d2-3c8faa535042', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '141', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='141INTERDAY MOMENTUM STRATEGIES\\na maximum drawdown of –16.6 percent from January 1988 to December \\n2010 (Dever, 2011).

However, in common \\nwith many other momentum strategies, its performance is poor since the \\n2008 fi  nancial crisis, a point that will be taken up later.\\nSince there aren’t many trades in the relatively limited amount of test \\ndata that we used due to the substantial holding periods, there is a risk of \\ndata-snooping bias in these results. The real test for the strategy is, as always, \\nin true out-of-sample testing.\\n ■ Extracting Roll Returns through \\nFuture versus ETF Arbitrage\\nIf futures’ total returns = spot returns + roll returns, then an obvious way \\nto extract roll return is buy the underlying asset and short the futures, if the \\nroll return is negative (i.e., under contango); and vice versa if the roll return \\nis positive (i.e., under backwardation). This will work as long as the sign of \\nthe roll return does not change quickly, as it usually doesn’t. This arbitrage \\nstrategy is also likely to result in a shorter holding period and a lower risk \\nthan the buy-and-hold strategy discussed in the previous section, since in \\nthat strategy we needed to hold the future for a long time before the noisy \\nspot return can be averaged out.\\nHowever, the logistics of buying and especially shorting the underlying \\nasset is not simple, unless an exchange-traded fund (ETF) exists that holds \\nthe asset. Such ETFs can be found for many precious metals. For example, \\nGLD actually owns physical gold, and thus tracks the gold spot price very \\nclosely. Gold futures have a negative roll return of –4.9 percent annualized \\nfrom December 1982 to May 2004. A backtest shows that holding a long \\nposition in GLD and a short position in GC yields an annualized return of \\n1.9 percent and a maximum drawdown of 0.8 percent from August 3, 2007, \\nto August 2, 2010. This might seem attractive, given that one can apply a \\nleverage of 5 or 6 and get a decent return with reasonable risk, but in reality \\nit is not. Remember that in contrast to owning futures, owning GLD actu-\\nally incurs fi  nancing cost, which is not very diff  erent from 1.9 percent over \\nthe backtest period! So the excess return of this strategy is close to zero.\\n(The astute reader might notice another caveat of our quick backtest of \\nGC versus GLD: the settlement or closing prices of GC are recorded at ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e38700f3-1e8d-4386-84f0-5d96937d50af', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '142', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='142\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\n1:30 p .m.

However, it doesn’t \\nmatter to us in this case because the trading signals are generated based on \\nGC closing prices alone.)\\nIf we try to look outside of precious metals ETFs to fi  nd such arbitrage \\nopportunities, we will be stumped. There are no ETFs that hold other physi-\\ncal commodities as opposed to commodities futures, due to the substantial \\nstorage costs of those commodities. However, there is a less exact form of \\narbitrage that allows us to extract the roll returns. ETFs containing com-\\nmodities producing companies often cointegrate with the spot price of \\nthose commodities, since these commodities form a substantial part of their \\nassets. So we can use these ETFs as proxy for the spot price and use them to \\nextract the roll returns of the corresponding futures. \\nOne good example is the arbitrage between the energy sector ETF XLE and \\nthe WTI crude oil futures CL. Since XLE and CL have diff erent closing times, it \\nis easier to study the arbitrage between XLE and the ETF USO instead, which \\ncontains nothing but front month contracts of CL. The strategy is simple: \\n ■ Short USO and long XLE whenever CL is in contango.\\n ■ Long USO and short XLE whenever CL is in backwardation. \\nThe APR is a very respectable 16 percent from April 26, 2006, to April 9, \\n2012, with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.

VX \\nis an example of such a future: It is very expensive to maintain a basket of \\noptions that replicate the underlying VIX index, and no ETF sponsors have \\nbeen foolish enough to do that. But, again, we do not need to fi  nd an instru-\\nment that tracks the spot price exactly—we just need to fi  nd one that has \\na high correlation (or anti-correlation) with the spot return. In the case of \\nVIX, the familiar ETF SPY fi  ts the bill. Because the S&P E-mini future ES has \\ninsignifi  cant roll return (about 1 percent annualized), it has almost the same \\nreturns as the underlying asset. Because it is certainly easier to trade futures \\nthan an ETF, we will investigate the performance of our earlier arbitrage \\nstrategy using ES instead.\\nV olatility Futures versus Equity Index Futures: \\nRedux\\nVX is a natural choice if we want to extract roll returns: its roll returns \\ncan be as low as –50 percent annualized. At the same time, it is highly anti-\\ncorrelated with ES, with a correlation coeffi  cient of daily returns reaching \\n–75 percent. In Chapter 5, we used the cointegration between VX and ES \\nto develop a profi  table mean-reverting strategy. Here, we will make use of \\nthe large roll return magnitude of VX, the small roll return magnitude of \\nES, and the anticorrelation of VX and ES to develop a momentum strategy. \\nThis strategy was proposed by Simon and Campasano (2012):\\n 1. If the price of the front contract of VX is higher than that of VIX by 0.1 \\npoint (contango) times the number of trading days untill settlement, \\nshort 0.3906 front contracts of VX and short 1 front contract of ES. \\nHold for one day.\\n 2.

So the diff  erence in price between VIX and \\nVX divided by the time to maturity is the roll return, and we buy VX if the \\nroll return is positive. Why didn’t we use the procedure in Example 5.3 where \\nwe use the slope of the futures log forward curve to compute the roll return \\nhere? That is because Equation 5.7 doesn’t work for VX, and therefore the VX \\nforward prices do not fall on a straight line, as explained in Chapter 5.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f4b44b0f-0401-497b-91df-1a0afeffdeca', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '144', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='144\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nNotice that the hedge ratio of this strategy is slightly diff  erent from that \\nreported by Simon and Campasano: It is based on the regression fi  t between \\nthe VX versus ES prices in Equation 5.11, not between their returns as in \\nthe original paper. The settlement is the day after the contracts expire.

This third way is a cross-\\nsectional strategy: W e can just buy a portfolio of futures in backwardation, \\nand simultaneously short a portfolio of futures in contango. The hope is that \\nthe returns of the spot prices cancel each other out (a not unreasonable \\nexpectation if we believe commodities’ spot prices are positively correlated \\nwith economic growth or some other macroeconomic indices), and we are \\nleft with the favorable roll returns. Daniel and Moskowitz described just \\nsuch a simple “cross-sectional” momentum strategy that is almost a mir-\\nror image of the linear long-short mean-reverting stock model proposed \\nby Khandani and Lo described in Chapter 3, albeit one with a much longer \\nlook-back and holding period (Daniel and Moskowitz, 2011). \\nFIGURE 6.4 Cumulative Returns of VX-ES Roll Returns Strategy', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b37b5437-dfe2-4063-9b5c-ee10009deaf4', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '145', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='145INTERDAY MOMENTUM STRATEGIES\\nA simplifi  ed version of the strategy is to rank the 12-month return (or 252 \\ntrading days in our program below) of a group of 52 physical commodities \\nevery day, and buy and hold the future with the highest return for 1 month (or \\n25 trading days) while short and hold the future with the lowest return for the \\nsame period.

In this \\ncase, we can fi  nd macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product \\n(GDP) growth or infl  ation rate and correlate them with the returns of each \\nfutures instrument, or we can again employ PCA.\\nIn recent years, with the advance of computer natural language process-\\ning and understanding capability, there is one other factor that has come into \\nuse. This is the so-called news sentiment score, our next topic.\\nNews Sentiment as a Fundamental Factor\\nWith the advent of machine-readable, or “elementized,” newsfeeds, it is now \\npossible to programmatically capture all the news items on a company, not \\njust those that fi  t neatly into one of the narrow categories such as earnings \\nannouncements or merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. Furthermore, \\nnatural language processing algorithms are now advanced enough to analyze \\nthe textual information contained in these news items, and assign a “senti-\\nment score” to each news article that is indicative of its price impact on a \\nstock, and an aggregation of these sentiment scores from multiple news ar-\\nticles from a certain period was found to be predictive of its future return. \\nFor example, Hafez and Xie, using RavenPack’s Sentiment Index, found that \\nbuying a portfolio of stocks with positive sentiment change and shorting \\none with negative sentiment change results in an APR from 52 percent to \\n156 percent and Sharpe ratios from 3.9 to 5.3 before transaction costs, de-\\npending on how many stocks are included in the portfolios (Hafez and Xie, \\n2012). The success of these cross-sectional strategies also demonstrates very \\nneatly that the slow diff  usion of news is the cause of stock momentum.\\nThere are other vendors besides RavenPack that provide news senti-\\nments on stocks. Examples include Recorded Future, thestocksonar.com, \\nand Thomson Reuters News Analytics. They diff  er on the scope of their \\nnews coverage and also on the algorithm they use to generate the senti-\\nment score.

In fact, \\na multimillion-dollar hedge fund was launched to implement this outland-\\nish idea (Bryant, 2010), though the validity of the research itself was under \\nattack (Buy the Hype, 2012).\\nMutual Funds Asset Fire Sale and \\nForced Purchases\\nResearchers Coval and Staff  ord (2007) found that mutual funds experienc-\\ning large redemptions are likely to reduce or eliminate their existing stock \\npositions. This is no surprise since mutual funds are typically close to fully \\ninvested, with very little cash reserves. More interestingly, funds experienc-\\ning large capital infl  ows tend to increase their existing stock positions rather \\nthan using the additional capital to invest in other stocks, perhaps because \\nnew investment ideas do not come by easily. Stocks disproportionately held \\nby poorly performing mutual funds facing redemptions therefore experi-\\nence negative returns. Furthermore, this asset “fi  re sale” by poorly perform-\\ning mutual funds is contagious. Since the fi  re sale depresses the stock prices, \\nthey suppress the performance of other funds holding those stocks, too, \\ncausing further redemptions at those funds. The same situation occurs in \\nreverse for stocks disproportionately held by superbly performing mutual \\nfunds with large capital infl  ows.

Based on this predic-\\ntion, we can also predict the future value of the pressure factor noted above. \\nIn other words, we can front-run the mutual funds in our selling (buying) \\nof the stocks they currently own. This front-running strategy generates an-\\nother 17 percent annualized return before transaction costs.\\nFinally, since these stocks experience such selling and buying pressures due \\nto liquidity-driven reasons, and suff  er suppression or elevation of their prices \\nthrough no fault or merit on their own, their stock prices often mean-revert \\nafter the mutual fund selling or buying pressure is over.

In fact, forced asset sales and purchases by hedge funds can also lead \\nto momentum in stocks, and that caused the August 2007 quant funds melt-\\ndown, as I explain in Chapter 8.\\n ■ Pros and Cons of Momentum Strategies\\nMomentum strategies, especially interday momentum strategies, often have \\ndiametrically opposite reward and risk characteristics in comparison to mean \\nreverting strategies. W e will compare their pros and cons in this section.\\nLet’s start with the cons. In my own trading experience, I have often \\nfound that it is harder to create profi  table momentum strategies, and those \\nthat are profi  table tend to have lower Sharpe ratios than mean-reversal strat-\\negies. There are two reasons for this.\\nFirst, as we have seen so far, many established momentum strategies have \\nlong look-back and holding periods. So clearly the number of independent \\ntrading signals is few and far in between. (W e may rebalance a momen-\\ntum portfolio every day, but that doesn’t make the trading signals more \\nindependent.) Fewer trading signals naturally lead to lower Sharpe ratio. \\nExample: The linear mean reversion model for S&P 500 stocks described in \\nChapter 4 relies on the short-term cross-sectional mean reversion proper-\\nties of stocks, and the holding period is less than a day. It has a high Sharpe \\nratio of 4.7. For the same universe of stocks, the opposite cross-sectional \\nmomentum strategy described earlier in this chapter has a holding period of \\n25 days, and though it performed similarly well pre-2008, the performance \\ncollapsed during the fi  nancial crisis years.\\nSecondly, research by Daniel and Moskowitz on “momentum crashes” \\nindicates that momentum strategies for futures or stocks tend to perform \\nmiserably for several years after a fi  nancial crisis (Daniel and Moskowitz, \\n2011). W e can see that easily from a plot of the S&P DTI index (Figure 6.7). \\nAs of this writing, it has suff  ered a drawdown of –25.9 percent since \\nDecember 5, 2008. Similarly, cross-sectional momentum in stocks also van-\\nished during the aftermath of the stock market crash in 2008–2009, and is \\nreplaced by strong mean reversion. W e still don’t know how long this mean \\nreversion regime will last: After the stock market crash of 1929, a represen-\\ntative momentum strategy did not return to its high watermark for more \\nthan 30 years! The cause of this crash is mainly due to the strong rebound of \\nshort positions following a market crisis.

For example, price momentum driven by earnings announcements used to \\nlast several days. Now it lasts barely until the market closes. This is quite un-\\nderstandable if we view price momentum as generated by the slow diff  usion \\nof information. As more traders learn about the information faster and earlier, \\nthe diff  usion—and thus, momentum—also ends sooner. This of course cre-\\nates a problem for the momentum trader, since we may have to constantly \\nshorten our holding period, yet there is no predictable schedule for doing so.\\nLest you think that we should just give up on momentum strategies, let’s \\nlook at the list of pros for momentum strategies. Such lists usually start with \\nthe ease of risk management. T o see why, we observe that there are two com-\\nmon types of exit strategies for momentum strategies: time-based and stop \\nloss. All the momentum strategies I have discussed so far involve only time-\\nbased exits. W e specify a holding period, and we exit a position when we \\nreached that holding period. But we can also impose a stop loss as the exit \\ncondition, or maybe as an additional exit condition. Stop losses are perfectly \\nconsistent with momentum strategies. If momentum has changed direction, \\nwe should enter into the opposite position. Since the original position would \\nhave been losing, and now we have exited it, this new entry signal eff  ectively \\nserved as a stop loss. In contrast, stop losses are not consistent with mean-\\nreverting strategies, because they contradict mean reversion strategies’ entry \\nsignals. (This point will be taken up again in Chapter 8.) Because of either a \\ntime-based exit or a stop loss, the loss of a momentum position is always lim-\\nited. In contrast, we can incur an enormous drawdown with just one position \\ndue to a mean-reverting strategy. (This is not to say that the cumulative loss of \\nsuccessive losing positions due to a momentum strategy won’t bankrupt us!) \\nNot only do momentum strategies survive risks well, they can thrive in \\nthem (though we have seen how poorly they did in the aftermath of risky \\nevents). For mean-reverting strategies, their upside is limited by their natu-\\nral profi  t cap (set as the “mean” to which the prices revert), but their down-\\nside can be unlimited. For momentum strategies, their upside is unlimited \\n(unless one arbitrarily imposes a profi  t cap, which is ill-advised), while their \\ndownside is limited. The more often “black swan” events occur, the more \\nlikely that a momentum strategy will benefi  t from them. The thicker the \\ntails of the returns distribution curve, or the higher its kurtosis, the bet-\\nter that market is for momentum strategies. (Remember the simulation in \\nExample 1.1?

The answer is no: the overnight returns are ne gative \\non average. On the contrary, many published results from 10 or 20 years \\nago have shown that PEAD lasted more than a day. This may be an example \\nwhere the duration of momentum is shortened due to increased awareness \\nof the existence of such momentum. It remains to be tested whether an even \\nshorter holding period may generate better returns.\\nDrift Due to Other Events\\nBesides earnings announcements, t here are ot her corporate events t hat \\nmay exhibit post-announcement drift: An incomp lete list inc ludes earn -\\nings guidance, analyst ratin gs and recommendation chan ges, same store \\nsales, and airline load factors. (A reasonable daily provider of such data is \\nthe Dow Jones newswire delivered by Newsware because it has the code \\nspecifi  c to the type of event attached to each stor y and is machine read -\\nable.) In theory, any announcements that prompt a reevaluation of the \\nfair market value of a company should induce a chan ge in its share price \\ntoward a new equilibrium price. (For a recent comprehensive stud y of all \\nthese events and their impact on the stock’s post-event returns, see Hafez, \\n2011.) Amon g these events, mer gers and acquisitions, of course, draw \\nthe attention of specialized hed ge funds that possess in-depth fundamental \\nknowledge of the acquirer and acquiree corporations. Y et a purely techni-\\ncal model like the one described earlier for PEAD can still extract an APR \\nof about 3 percent for mer gers and acquisitions (M&As). (It is interestin g \\nto note that contrary to common beliefs, Hafez found that the acquiree’s \\nstock price falls more than the acquirer’s after the initial announcemen t \\nof the acquisition.)\\nIn Chapter 6, we described how momentum in a stock’s price is gener -\\nated by large funds’ forced buyin g or selling of the stock.

As I demonstrate in\\nExample 8.1, this constant leverage requirement has some counterintuitive\\nand important consequences. Suppose the RMZ dropped precipitously one \\nday. That would imply that you would need to substantially reduce the posi-\\ntions in your portfolio by selling stocks across the board in order to keep the \\nleverage constant. Conversely, if the RMZ rose that day, you would need to \\nincrease the positions by buying stocks.\\nNow suppose you are actually the sponsor of an ETF, and that portfolio \\nof yours is none other than a 3× leveraged ETF such as DRN (a real estate \\nETF), and its equity is over a hundred million dollars. If you think that this \\nrebalancing procedure (selling the component stocks when the portfolio’s \\nreturn is ne gative, and vice versa) near the market close would generate \\nmomentum in the market value of the portfolio, you would be right.\\n(A large change in the market index generates momentum in the same \\ndirection for both leveraged long or s hort ETFs. I f the change is positive, \\na short ETF would experience a decrease in equit y, and its sponsor would \\nneed to reduce its short positions. Therefore, it would also need to bu y \\nstocks, just as the long ETF would.)\\nW e can test this hypothesis by constructin g a very simple momentum \\nstrategy: buy DRN if the return from previous day’s close to 15 minutes ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='998cafb7-6c76-4ab8-9eb8-abb51c41073f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '164', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='164\\nALGORITHMIC TRADING\\nbefore market close is greater than 2 percent, and sell if the return is smaller \\nthan −2 percent. Exit t he position at t he market close. Note that this mo-\\nmentum strategy is based on t he momentum o f the underlying stocks, so \\nit should be a ff ecting the near-market-close returns of the unlevered ETFs \\nsuch as SPY as well. W e use the leveraged ETFs as trading instruments sim-\\nply to ma gnify the eff  ect. The APR of trading DRN is 15 percent with a \\nSharpe ratio of 1.8 from October 12, 2011, to October 25, 2012.\\nNaturally, the return of this strategy should increase as the aggregate assets \\nof all leveraged ETFs increase. It was reported that the total AUM of lever-\\naged ETFs (including both long and short funds) at the end of January 2009 is \\n$19 billion (Cheng and Madhavan, 2009). These authors also estimated that a \\n1 percent move of SPX will necessitate a buying or selling of stocks constitut-\\ning about 17 percent of the market-on-close volume. This is obviously going \\nto have signifi cant market impact, which is momentum inducing. (A more up-\\ndated analysis was published by Rodier, Haryanto, Shum, and Hejazi, 2012.)\\nThere is of course another event that will aff  ect the equity of an ETF, lev-\\neraged or not: the fl  ow of investors’ cash. A large infl  ow into long leveraged \\nETFs will cause positive momentum on the underlying stocks’ prices, while \\na large infl  ow into short leveraged (“inverse”) ETFs will cause negative mo-\\nmentum. So it is theoretically possible that on the same day when the market \\nindex had a large positive return many investors sold the long leveraged ETFs \\n(perhaps as part of a mean-revertin g strategy). This would have neutralized \\nthe momentum. But our backtests show that this did not happen often.\\n■ High-Frequency Strategies\\nMost high-frequency momentum strategies involve extracting information \\nfrom the order book, and the basic idea is simple: If the bid size is much \\nbigger than the ask size, expect the price to tick up and vice versa. This \\nidea is backed by academic research. For example, an approximately linear \\nrelationship between the imbalance of bid versus ask sizes and short-term \\nprice changes in the Nasdaq market was found (Maslov and Mills, 2001). As \\nexpected, the eff  ect is stronger for lower volume stocks. The eff  ect is not \\nlimited to just the national best bid off  er (NBBO) prices: an imbalance of the\\nentire order book also induces price changes for a stock on the Stockholm \\nstock market (Hellström and Simonsen, 2006).\\nThere are a number of hi gh-frequency momentum strate gies based on \\nthis p henomenon.

(In my descriptions that follow, I \\nfocus on making an initial long trade, but, of course, there is a symmetrical \\nopportunity on the short side.) \\nIn markets that fi  ll orders on a pro-rata basis such as the Eurodollar fu -\\ntures trading on CME, the simplest way to benefi  t from this expectation is\\njust to “join the bid” immediately, so that whenever there is a fi ll on the bid \\nside, we will get a llocated part o f that fi ll. T o ensure that the bid and ask \\nprices are more likely to move higher rather than lower after we are fi  lled, \\nwe join the bid only when the original bid size is muc h larger than the ask \\nsize. This is ca lled the ratio trade, because we expect t he proportion o f the \\noriginal order to be fi lled is equal to the ratio between our own order size \\nand the aggregate order size at the bid price. Once the buying pressure caus-\\nes the bid price to move up one or more tic ks, then we can sell at a profi t, \\nor we can simply place a sell order at the best ask (if the bid-ask spread is \\nlarger than the round trip commission per share). If the bid price doesn’t \\nmove up or our sell limit order doesn’t get fi  lled, we can probably still sell \\nat the original best bid price because of the lar ge bid size, with the loss o f \\ncommissions only.\\nIn markets where the bid-ask spread is bigger than two ticks, there is\\nanother simple trade to benefi  t from the expectation of an uptick. Simply\\nplace the bu y order at the best bid plus one tick. If this is fi  lled, then we \\nplace a sell order at the best ask minus one tick and hope that it is fi  lled. But \\nif it is not, we can probably still sell it at the original best bid, with the loss \\nof commissions plus one tick. This is called ticking or quote matching. For this \\ntrade to be profi  table, we need to make sure that the round trip commission\\nper share is less than the bid-ask spread minus two ticks.

The original best bid be-\\nfore it was front-run may be cancelled if the trader knows that he has been \\nfront-run, leaving us with a lower bid price to unload our inventory. Or the \\nwhole situation could be set up as a trap for us: the trader who placed the \\noriginal best bid actually wanted to sell us stocks at a price better than her \\nown bid. So once we bou ght her stocks plus one tick, she would immedi -\\nately cancel the bid.)\\nEven when there is no preexisting buying pressure or bid-ask size imbal-\\nance, we can create the illusion of one (often calledmomentum ignition). This \\nworks for markets with time priority for orders instead of using pro-rata \\nfi lls. Let’s assume we start wit h very similar best bid and ask sizes. W e will \\nplace a large buy limit order at the best bid to create the impression of buy-\\ning pressure, and simultaneously place a small sell limit order at the bes t \\nask. This would tric k traders to buy at t he ask price since t hey anticipate \\nan uptick, fi  lling our small sell order. At this point, we immediately cancel \\nthe large buy order. The best bid and ask sizes are now roughly equal again. \\nMany of those traders who bought earlier expecting a large buying pressure \\nmay now sell back their holdings at a loss, and we can then buy them at the \\noriginal best bid. This is calledfl ipping.\\nThere is a danger to creating the illusion of buying pressure—somebody \\njust might call our bluff  and actually fi  ll our large buy order. In this case, we \\nmight have to sell it at a loss. Conversely, if we suspect a large buy order is \\ndue to fl  ippers, then we can sell to the fl  ippers and drive down the bid price. \\nW e hope that the fl  ippers will capitulate and sell their new inventory, driv-\\ning the ask price down as well, so that we can then cover our short position \\nbelow the original bid price. How do we know that the large buy order is due \\nto fl  ippers in the fi  rst place? W e may have to record how often a large bid gets \\ncanceled instead of getting fi  lled. If you subscribe to the private data feeds \\nfrom the exchanges such as ITCH from Nasdaq, EDGX Book Feed from \\nDirect Edge, or the PITCH feed from BATS, you will receive the detailed \\nlife history of an order including any modifi  cations or partial fi  lls (Arnuk and \\nSaluzzi, 2012).

Indeed, because of the prevalence of these \\ntypes of high-frequency strategies that “front-run” large bid or as k orders, \\nmany traditional market makers no longer quote large sizes.

(Of \\ncourse, there are other reasons for avoiding displaying large quotes: market \\nmakers do not like to keep large inventories that can result from having their \\nlarge quotes fi lled.)

This short-term price momentum occurs because of the large \\nnumber of stop orders placed at or near the support and resistance levels. \\nT o understand this further, let’s just look at the support levels, as the situ-\\nation with resistance levels is symmetrical. Once the price drops enough to \\nbreach a support level, those sell stop orders are triggered and thereby drive \\nthe prices down further. Given this knowledge, high-frequency traders can, \\nof course, create artifi  cial selling pressure by submittin g large sell orders \\nwhen the price is close enough to a support level, hoping to drive the nex t \\ntick down. Once the stop orders are triggered and a downward momentum \\nis in force, these high-frequency traders can cover their short positions for \\na quick profi  t.\\nIf we have access to the order fl  ow information of a market, then we have aw\\nhighly valuable information stream that goes beyond the usual bid/ask/last \\nprice stream. As Lyons discussed in the context of currencies trading, “order \\nfl  ow” is signed transaction volume (Lyons, 2001). If a trader buys 100 units \\nfrom a dealer/market maker/order book, the order fl  ow is 100, and it is \\n−100 if the trader sells 100 units instead. What “buying” from an order book \\nmeans is that a trader buys at the ask price, or, equivalently, the trader submits \\na market order to buy. Empirical research indicates that order fl ow informa-\\ntion is a good predictor of price movements. This is because market makers \\ncan distill important fundamental information from order fl  ow information, \\nand set the bid-ask prices accordingly. For example, if a major hedge fund just \\nlearns about a major piece of breaking news, their algorithms will submit large \\nmarket orders of the same sign in a split second.

T o nov-\\nice traders, risk management is driven by “loss aversion”: we simply \\ndon’t like the feelin g of losin g money.

Risk mana gement in this chapter is based on \\nthis ob jective.\\nThe key concept in risk management is the prudent use of leverage, \\nwhich we can optimize via the Kell y formula or some numerical methods \\nthat maximize compounded growth rate. But sometimes reality forces us \\nto limit the maximum drawdown of an account. One obvious wa y of ac -\\ncomplishing this is the use of stop loss, but it is often problematic. The other\\nway is constant proportion portfolio insurance, which tries to maximize the \\nupside of the account in addition to preventing large drawdowns. Both will\\nbe discussed here.

They pay no mind to draw-\\ndowns and volatilities of returns. So the optimal leverage to them means one \\nthat can maximize the net worth or, equivalently, the compounded growth rate.\\nW e’ll discuss here three methods of computin g the optimal levera ge \\nthat maximizes the compounded growth rate. Each method has its own as -\\nsumptions and drawbacks, and we try to be agnostic as to which method\\nyou should adopt. But, in all cases, we have to make the assumption tha t \\nthe future probabilit y distribution of returns of the market is the same as \\nin the past. This is usually an incorrect assumption, but this is the best that \\nquantitative models can do. Even more restrictive, many risk managemen t \\ntechniques assume further that the probability distribution of returns of the \\nstrategy itself is the same as in the past. And fi  nally, the most restrictive of all y\\nassumes that the probability distribution of returns of the strategy is Gauss-\\nian. As is often the case in mathematical modelin g, the most restrictive as-\\nsumptions give rise to the most ele gant and simple solution, so I will star t\\nthis survey with the Kelly formula under the Gaussian assumption.\\nIf the maximum drawdown of an account with a certain leverage is −100 \\npercent, this leverage cannot be optimal because the compounded growth \\nrate will also be −100 percent. So an optimal leverage implies that we must \\nnot be ruined (equity reachin g zero) at any point in history, rather self -\\nevidently! But sometimes our risk managers (perhaps it is a spouse for in -\\ndependent traders) tell us that we are allowed to have a much smaller mag-\\nnitude of drawdown than 1. In this case, the maximum drawdown allowed\\nforms an additional constraint in the leverage optimization problem.\\nNo matter how the optimal levera ge is determined, the one central \\ntheme is that the leverage should be kept constant. This is necessary to opti-\\nmize the growth rate whether or not we have the maximum drawdown con-\\nstraint. Keeping a constant leverage may sound rather mundane, but can be \\ncounterintuitive when put into action.

However, if your P&L was negative in the last period, it forces\\nyou to sell stocks into the loss. Example 8.1 illustrates this.\\nMany analysts believe that this “sellin g into losses” feature of the ris k \\nmanagement techniques causes conta gion in fi  nancial crises. (In particular, \\nthis was cited as a cause of the August 2007 meltdown of quant funds; see \\nKhandani and Lo, 2007). This is because often many funds are holding similar \\npositions in their portfolios. If one fund suff ers losses, perhaps due to some \\nunrelated strategies, it is prone to liquidate positions across all its portfolios \\ndue to the constant leverage requirement, causing losses for all other funds \\nthat hold those positions. The losses force all these other funds to a lso liq-\\nuidate their positions and thus exacerbate the losses for everyone: a vicious \\ncycle. One might think of this as a tragedy of the commons: self-preservation \\n(“risk management”) for one fund can lead to catastrophe for all.\\nExample 8.1:  The Implications of the\\nConstant Leverage Requirement\\nThe central requirement for all ways of optimizing leverage described\\nin this chapter is that the leverage be kept constant at all times. This\\ncan have some counterintuitive consequences.\\nIf you started with $100K equity in your account, and your\\nstrategy’s optimal leverage was determined to be 5, then you should\\nhave a portfolio with market value of $500K.\\nIf, however, you lost $10K in one day and your equity was reduced\\nto $90K, with a portfolio market value of $490K, then you need to\\nliquidate a further $40K of your portfolio so that its updated market r\\nvalue became 5 × $90K = $450K. This selling into the loss may make\\nsome people uncomfortable, but it is a necessary part of many risk \\nmanagement schemes.\\nSuppose you then gained $20K the next day. What should your\\nportfolio market value be? And what should you do to achieve that\\nmarket value?\\nThe new portfolio market value should be 5 × ($90K + $20K) =\\n$550K. Since your current portfolio market value was just $450K + \\n$20K = $470K, this means you need to add $80K worth of (long or \\nshort) securities to the portfolio.

It can be proven that if the Gaussian assumption \\nis a good approximation, then the Kelly leverage f will generate the highest f\\ncompounded growth rate of equity, assuming that all profi  ts are reinvested. \\nHowever, even if the Gaussian assumption is really valid, we will inevitably \\nsuff  er estimation errors when we try to estimate what the “true” mean and \\nvariance of the excess return are. And no matter how good one’s estima -\\ntion method is, there is no guarantee that the future mean and variance will\\nbe the same as the historical ones. The consequence of using an overesti -\\nmated mean or an underestimated variance is dire: Either case will lead to \\nan overestimated optimal leverage, and if this overestimated leverage is high \\nenough, it will eventually lead to ruin: equity going to zero. However, the \\nconsequence of usin g an underestimated levera ge is merely a submaximal\\ncompounded growth rate. Many traders justifi  ably prefer the later scenario, \\nand they routinely deploy a leverage equal to half of what the Kelly formula \\nrecommends: the so-called half-Kelly leverage.\\nMy actual experience usin g Kelly’s optimal levera ge is that it is best \\nviewed as an upper bound rather than as the leverage that must be used. \\nOften, the Kelly leverage given by the backtest (or a short period of walk -\\nforward test) is so high that it far exceeds the maximum leverage allowed by \\nour brokers. At other times, the Kelly leverage would have bankrupted us \\neven in backtest, due to the non-Gaussian distributions of returns. In other \\nwords, the maximum drawdown in backtest is −1 using the Kelly leverage,\\nwhich implies settin g the levera ge by numerically optimizin g the growth \\nrate using a more realistic non-Gaussian distribution might be more practi-\\ncal.

However, if the strategy suff  ers \\nlosses, we will not transfer any cash between the cash and the trading subac-\\ncount.

(The more common, less optimal, way to wind down a strat-\\negy is driven by the emotional breakdown of the portfolio manager.)\\nNotice tha t because of this separation of accounts, this scheme is not\\nequivalent to just usin g a levera ge of L = fD in our total account equity.ff\\nThere is no guarantee that the maximum drawdown will not exceed −D \\neven with a lowered leverage of ff D.

The common usa ge is to use stop \\nloss to exit an existing position whenever its unrealized P&L drops below a \\nthreshold. But after we exit this position, we are free to reenter into a new \\nposition, perhaps even one of the same sign, sometime later. In other words, \\nwe are not concerned about the cumulative P&L or the drawdown of the \\nstrategy.\\n The less common usage is to use stop loss to exit the strategy completely \\nwhen our drawdown drops below a threshold. This usage of stop loss is awk-\\nward—it can happen only once during the lifetime of a strategy, and ideally \\nwe would never have to use it. That is the reason why CPPI is preferred over \\nusing stop loss for the same protection. The rest of this section is concerned\\nwith the fi  rst, more common usage of stop loss.\\nStop loss can only prevent the unrealized P&L from exceedin g our self-\\nimposed limit if the market is always open whenever we are holding a posi-\\ntion. For example, it is eff  ective if we do not hold positions after the market \\ncloses or if we are tradin g in currencies or some futures where the elec -\\ntronic market is always open except for weekends and holidays. Otherwise, \\nif the prices “gap” down or up when the market reopens, the stop loss may \\nbe executed at a price much worse than what our maximum allowable loss \\ndictates. As we said earlier, the purchases of options will be necessar y to \\neliminate this risk, but that may be expensive to implement and is valuable\\nonly for expected market downtime.\\nIn some extreme circumstances, sto p loss is useless even if the market \\nis open but when all liquidit y providers decide to withdraw their liquidit y ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='fd060d18-34a4-4b92-b6e3-cceae2fea261', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '183', 'file_name': 'Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Ernest Chan ( PDFDrive ).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 9150037, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='183RISK MANAGEMENT\\nsimultaneously.

At fi rst blush, stop loss seems to contra dict the central assump-\\ntion of mean reversion. For exam ple, if prices dro p and we enter into a \\nlong position, and prices drop some more and thus induce a loss, we should\\nexpect the prices to rise eventua lly if we believe in mean reversion o f this \\nprice series. So it is not sensible to “stop loss” and exit this position when the \\nprice is so low . Indeed, I have never backtested any mean-reverting strategy \\nwhose APR or Sharpe ratio is increased by imposing a stop loss. \\nThere is just one problem with this argument: What happens if the mean \\nreversion model has permanently stopped workin g while we are in a posi -\\ntion? In fi  nance, unlike in physics, laws are not immutable. As I have been \\nrepeating, what was true of a price series before may not be true in the \\nfuture. So a mean-reverting price series can under go a regime change and \\nbecome a trending price series for an extended period of time, maybe for -\\never. In this case, a stop loss will be very eff ective in preventing catastrophic \\nlosses, and it will allow us time to consider the possibility that we should just \\nshut down the strategy before incurring a 100 percent loss. Furthermore, \\nthese kinds of “turncoat” price series that regime-change from mean rever-\\nsion to momentum would never show up in our catalog of profi  table mean\\nreversion strategies because our catalog would not have included mean -\\nreverting strategies that failed in their backtests. Survivorship bias was in \\naction when I claimed earlier that stop loss alwa ys lowers the performance \\nof mean-reverting strategies. It is more accurate to say that stop loss always \\nlowers the performance of mean-reverting strategies when the pricesremain \\nmean reverting, but it certainly improves the performance of those strategies\\nwhen the prices suff er a regime change and start to trend!\\nGiven this consideration of re gime chan ge and survivorship bias, how \\nshould we impose a stop loss on a mean-revertin g strategy, since any suc-\\ncessfully backtested mean-revertin g strategy suff  ers survivorship bias and \\nwill always show lowered performance if we impose a stop loss?

Thus, \\na continuously updated momentum trading signal serves as a de facto stop \\nloss. This is the reason momentum models do not present the same kind of \\ntail risk that mean-reverting models do.\\n■ Risk Indicators\\nMany of the ris k management measures we discussed above are reactive: \\nWe  lower the order size when we incur a loss, or we stop trading altogether \\nwhen a maximum drawdown has been reached. But it would be much more \\nadvantageous if we could proactively avoid those periods of time when the \\nstrategy is likely to incur loss. This is the role of leading risk indicators. \\nThe obvious distinction between leadin g risk indicators and the more \\ngeneral notion of risk indicators is that leading risk indicators let us predict \\nwhether the next period will be risky for our investment, while general risk \\nindicators are just contemporaneous with a risky period.\\nThere is no one risk indicator that is applicable to all strategies: What is a \\nrisky period to one strategy may be a highly profi  table period for another. For \\nexample, we might try using the VIX, the implied volatility index, as the lead-\\ning risk indicator to predict the risk of the next-day return of the buy-on-gap \\nstock strategy described in Chapter 4. That strategy had an annualized average \\nreturn of around 8.7 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 1.5 from May 11, 2006, to \\nApril 24, 2012. But if the preceding day’s VIX is over 35, a common threshold \\nfor highly risky periods, then the day’s annualized average return will be 17.2 \\npercent with a Sharpe ratio of 1.4. Clearly, this strategy benefi  ts from the so-\\ncalled risk! However, VIX > 35 is a very good leading risk indicator for the \\nFSTX opening gap strategy depicted in Chapter 7. That strategy had an annual-\\nized average return of around 13 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 1.4 from July \\n16, 2004, to May 17, 2012. If the preceding day’s VIX is over 35, then the day’s \\nannualized average return drops to 2.6 percent and the Sharpe ratio to 0.16. \\nClearly, VIX tells us to avoid trading on the following day.\\nBesides VIX, another commonly used leadin g risk indicator is the TED\\nspread.

(The TED spread is useful notwithstanding \\nthe fraudulent manipu lation o f LIBOR rates by t he banks to ma ke t hem\\nappear lower, as discovered by Snider and Yo ule, 2010. What matters is the \\nrelative value of the TED spread over time, not its absolute value.)\\nThere are other risky assets that at diff erent times have served as risk indi-\\ncators, though we would have to test them carefully to see if they are leading \\nindicators. These assets include high yield bonds (as represented, for exam-\\nple, by the ETF HYG) and emerging market currencies such as the Mexican \\npeso (MXN). During t he European debt crisis o f 2011, the MXN became \\nparticularly sensitive to bad news, even though the Mexican economy re -\\nmained healthy throughout. Commentators attributed this sensitivity to the\\nfact that traders are using the MXN as a proxy for all risky assets in general.\\nMore recently, traders can also watch the ETF’s ONN and OFF. ONN \\ngoes up when the market is in a “risk-on” mood; that is, when the prices of \\nrisky assets are bid up. ONN basically holds a basket of risky assets. OFF is \\njust the mirror image of ONN. So a high value of OFF may be a good leading \\nrisk indicator. At the time of this writing, these ETFs have only about seven \\nmonths of history, so there is not enough evidence to confi  rm that they have\\npredictive value.\\nAs we mentioned in the section on high-frequency trading in Chapter 7, at \\nshort time scales, those who have access to order fl  ow information can detect \\na sudden and large change in order fl  ow , which often indicates that important \\ninformation has come into the possession of institutional traders. This large \\nchange in order fl  ow is negative if the asset in question is risky, such as stocks, \\ncommodities, or risky currencies; it is positive if the asset is low risk, such as \\nU.S. treasuries or USD, JPY , or CHF. As we learned before, order fl  ow is a \\npredictor of future price change (Lyons, 2001). Thus, order fl  ow can be used \\nas a short-term leadin g indicator of risk before that information becomes \\nmore widely dispersed in the market and causes the price to change more.\\nThere are also risk indicators that are very specifi  c to a strategy. W e men-\\ntioned in Chapter 4 that oil price is a good leading risk indicator for the\\npair trading of GLD versus GDX. Ot her commodity prices suc h as that of \\ngold may also be good leading risk indicators for pair tradin g of ETFs for \\ncountries or companies that produce them.

Since the occurrence of fi nancial panic or crises is relatively \\nrare, it is very easy to fall victim to data-snooping bias when we try to decide \\nwhether an indicator is useful. And, of course, no fi  nancial indicators can pre-\\ndict natural and other nonfi nancial disasters.

The strategies described in this book serve only to illustrate the \\ngeneral technique or concept, but they are not guaranteed to be without \\nthose very pitfalls that I detailed in Chapter 1. Even if I were to carefully \\nscrub them of pitfalls, good strategies can still be victims of regime changes. \\nReaders are invited and encouraged to perform out-of-sample testing on the \\nstrategies in this book to see for themselves.\\nInstead of recipes, what I hope to convey is the deeper reasons, the basic \\nprinciples, why certain strategies should work and why others shouldn’t. \\nOnce we grasp the basic ineffi  ciencies of certain markets (e.g., regression \\nto the mean, the presence of roll returns in futures, the need for end-of-day \\nrebalancing in leveraged exchange-traded funds [ETFs]), it is actually quite \\neasy to come up with a strategy to exploit them. This notion of understand-\\ning the ineffi  ciency fi  rst and constructing a strategy later is why I empha-\\nsized simple and linear strategies. Why create all kinds of arbitrary rules \\nwhen the ineffi  ciency can be exploited by a simple model?\\nThe other notion I wanted to convey is that the approach to algorithmic \\ntrading can be rather scientifi  c. In science, we form a hypothesis, express it \\nas a quantitative model, and then test it against new , unseen data to see if \\nthe model is predictive. If the model failed with certain data, we try to fi  nd \\nout the reasons for the failures, perhaps add certain variables to the model, \\nand try again. This is a very similar process to how we should approach \\nalgorithmic trading.

A hypothesis was formed that had \\nto do with the high crude oil price. When oil price was added to the input \\nvariables, the cointegration model started to work again. This scientifi  c pro-\\ncess is most helpful when a strategy underperforms the backtest, and we \\nwanted to know why. Instead of blindly adding more rules, more indicators, \\nto the model and hoping that they miraculously improve the model perfor-\\nmance, we should look for a fundamental reason and then quantitatively test \\nwhether this fundamental reason is valid.\\nDespite the eff  orts to make the trading process scientifi  c and rule based, \\nthere are still areas where subjective judgment is important. For example, \\nwhen there is a major event looming, do you trust that your model will be-\\nhave as your backtest predicted, or do you lower your leverage or even tem-\\nporarily shut down the model in anticipation? Another example is off  ered \\nby the application of the Kelly formula to a portfolio of strategies. Should \\nwe allocate capital among these strategies based on the equity of the whole \\nportfolio, so that the good performance of some strategies is subsidizing \\nthe poor performance of others in the short term? Or should we apply the \\nKelly formula to each strategy on its own, so that we quickly deleverage \\nthose strategies that perform poorly recently? Mathematics tells us that the \\nformer solution is optimal, but that’s assuming the expected returns and \\nvolatilities of the strategies are unchanging. Can one really say that such ex-\\npectations are unchanged given a recent period of severe drawdown?\\n(On the fi  rst judgment call, my experience has been that if your model \\nhas survived the backtest during prior stressful periods, there is no reason \\nto lower its leverage in the face of coming crisis. It is much better to start off   \\nwith a more conservative leverage during good times than to have to lower \\nit in bad ones. As Donald Rumsfeld once said, it is the “unknown unknowns” \\nthat will harm us, not the “known unknowns.” Unfortunately, we can’t shut \\ndown our models before the unknown unknowns strike. On the second \\njudgment call, my experience has been that applying Kelly to each strategy \\nindependently so as to allow each one to wither and die quickly when it \\nunderperforms is more practical than applying Kelly asset allocation across \\nall strategies.)\\nAs these examples show , subjective judgment is often needed because \\nthe statistical properties of fi  nancial time series are not stationary, and sci-\\nence can really only deal with stationary statistics. (I am using stationary in \\na sense diff  erent from the stationarity of time series in Chapter 2. Here, it \\nmeans the probability distribution of prices remains unchanged through-\\nout time.)

According to Alpha\\nmagazine, the highest earning investment manager of 2008 was Jim\\nSimons of Renaissance Technologies Corp., a long-standing proponent of\\nhigh-frequency strategies. Dr. Simons reportedly earned $2.5 billion in 2008\\nalone. While no institution was thoroughly tracking performance of high-\\nfrequency funds when this book was written, colloquial evidence suggests\\nthat the majority of high-frequency managers delivered positive returns\\nin 2008, whereas 70 percent of low-frequency practitioners lost money,\\naccording to the New York Times. The proﬁtability of high-frequency en-\\nterprises is further corroborated by the exponential growth of the industry.\\nAccording to a February 2009 report from Aite Group, high-frequency trad-\\ning now accounts for over 60 percent of trading volume coming through the\\nﬁnancial exchanges. High-frequency trading professionals are increasingly\\nin demand and reap top-dollar compensation. Even in the worst months\\nof the 2008 crisis, 50 percent of all open positions in ﬁnance involved ex-\\npertise in high-frequency trading (Aldridge, 2008). Despite the demand for\\ninformation on this topic, little has been published to help investors under-\\nstand and implement high-frequency trading systems.\\nSo what is high-frequency trading, and what is its allure? The main\\ninnovation that separates high-frequency from low-frequency trading is a\\nhigh turnover of capital in rapid computer-driven responses to changing\\nmarket conditions. High-frequency trading strategies are characterized by\\na higher number of trades and a lower average gain per trade. Many tra-\\nditional money managers hold their trading positions for weeks or even\\n1', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9ace8c48-2c03-4779-9c39-91d4b1a6647c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '16', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc01 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 18:28 Printer: Yet to come\\n2 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nmonths, generating a few percentage points in return per trade. By compar-\\nison, high-frequency money managers execute multiple trades each day,\\ngaining a fraction of a percent return per trade, with few, if any, posi-\\ntions carried overnight. The absence of overnight positions is important to\\ninvestors and portfolio managers for three reasons:\\n1. The continuing globalization of capital markets extends most of the\\ntrading activity to 24-hour cycles, and with the current volatility in\\nthe markets, overnight positions can become particularly risky. High-\\nfrequency strategies do away with overnight risk.\\n2. High-frequency strategies allow for full transparency of account hold-\\nings and eliminate the need for capital lock-ups.\\n3. Overnight positions taken out on margin have to be paid for at the in-\\nterest rate referred to as an overnight carry rate. The overnight carry\\nrate is typically slightly above LIBOR. With volatility in LIBOR and\\nhyperinﬂation around the corner, however, overnight positions can\\nbecome increasingly expensive and therefore unproﬁtable for many\\nmoney managers. High-frequency strategies avoid the overnight carry,\\ncreating considerable savings for investors in tight lending conditions\\nand in high-interest environments.\\nHigh-frequency trading has additional advantages. High-frequency\\nstrategies have little or no correlation with traditional long-term buy\\nand hold strategies, making high-frequency strategies valuable diversiﬁca-\\ntion tools for long-term portfolios. High-frequency strategies also require\\nshorter evaluation periods because of their statistical properties, which\\nare discussed in depth further along in this book. If an average monthly\\nstrategy requires six months to two years of observation to establish the\\nstrategy’s credibility, the performance of many high-frequency strategies\\ncan be statistically ascertained within a month.\\nIn addition to the investment beneﬁts already listed, high-frequency\\ntrading provides operational savings and numerous beneﬁts to society.\\nFrom the operational perspective, the automated nature of high-frequency\\ntrading delivers savings through reduced staff headcount as well as a lower\\nincidence of errors due to human hesitation and emotion.\\nAmong the top societal beneﬁts of high-frequency strategies are the\\nfollowing:\\nr Increased market efﬁciency\\nr Added liquidity\\nr Innovation in computer technology\\nr Stabilization of market systems', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='044c7ddf-861e-448e-8a14-1bd86aa22fce', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '17', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc01 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 18:28 Printer: Yet to come\\nIntroduction 3\\nHigh-frequency strategies identify and trade away temporary market\\ninefﬁciencies and impound information into prices more quickly. Many\\nhigh-frequency strategies provide signiﬁcant liquidity to the markets, mak-\\ning the markets work more smoothly and with fewer frictional costs for all\\ninvestors. High-frequency traders encourage innovation in computer tech-\\nnology and facilitate new solutions to relieve Internet communication bot-\\ntlenecks. They also stimulate the invention of new processors that speed\\nup computation and digital communication. Finally, high-frequency trading\\nstabilizes market systems by ﬂushing out toxic mispricing.\\nA ﬁt analogy was developed by Richard Olsen, CEO of Oanda, Inc. At a\\nMarch 2009 FXWeek conference, Dr. Olsen suggested that if ﬁnancial mar-\\nkets can be compared to a human body, then high-frequency trading is anal-\\nogous to human blood that circulates throughout the body several times a\\nday ﬂushing out toxins, healing wounds, and regulating temperature. Low-\\nfrequency investment decisions, on the other hand, can be thought of as\\nactions that destabilize the circulatory system by reacting too slowly. Even\\na simple decision to take a walk in the park exposes the body to infection\\nand other dangers, such as slips and falls. It is high-frequency trading that\\nprovides quick reactions, such as a person rebalancing his footing, that can\\nstabilize markets’ reactions to shocks.\\nMany successful high-frequency strategies run on foreign exchange,\\nequities, futures, and derivatives. By its nature, high-frequency trading can\\nbe applied to any sufﬁciently liquid ﬁnancial instrument. (A “liquid instru-\\nment” can be a ﬁnancial security that has enough buyers and sellers to\\ntrade at any time of the trading day.)\\nHigh-frequency trading strategies can be executed around the clock.\\nElectronic foreign exchange markets are open 24 hours, 5 days a week.\\nU.S. equities can now be traded “outside regular trading hours,” from 4A.M.\\nEST to midnight EST every business day. Twenty-four-hour trading is also\\nbeing developed for selected futures and options.\\nMany high-frequency ﬁrms are based in New York, Connecticut,\\nLondon, Singapore, and Chicago. Many Chicago ﬁrms use their proximity\\nto the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to develop fast trading strategies for\\nfutures, options, and commodities. New York and Connecticut ﬁrms tend\\nto be generalist, with a preference toward U.S. equities. European time\\nzones give Londoners an advantage in trading currencies, and Singapore\\nﬁrms tend to specialize in Asian markets. While high-frequency strategies\\ncan be run from any corner of the world at any time of day, natural afﬁlia-\\ntions and talent clusters emerge at places most conducive to speciﬁc types\\nof ﬁnancial securities.\\nThe largest high-frequency names worldwide include Millennium,\\nDE Shaw, Worldquant, and Renaissance Technologies.

Proprietary trading\\ndesks of major banks, too, dabble in high-frequency products, but often get\\nspun out into hedge fund structures once they are successful.\\nCurrently, four classes of trading strategies are most popular in\\nthe high-frequency category: automated liquidity provision, market mi-\\ncrostructure trading, event trading, and deviations arbitrage. Table 1.1 sum-\\nmarizes key properties of each type.\\nDeveloping high-frequency trading presents a set of challenges previ-\\nously unknown to most money managers. The ﬁrst is dealing with large\\nvolumes of intra-day data. Unlike the daily data used in many traditional\\ninvestment analyses, intra-day data is much more voluminous and can be\\nirregularly spaced, requiring new tools and methodologies. As always, most\\nprudent money managers require any trading system to have at least two\\nyears worth of back testing before they put money behind it. Working with\\ntwo or more years of intra-day data can already be a great challenge for\\nmany. Credible systems usually require four or more years of data to allow\\nfor full examination of potential pitfalls.\\nThe second challenge is the precision of signals. Since gains may\\nquickly turn to losses if signals are misaligned, a signal must be precise\\nenough to trigger trades in a fraction of a second.\\nSpeed of execution is the third challenge. Traditional phone-in orders\\nare not sustainable within the high-frequency framework. The only reliable\\nway to achieve the required speed and precision is computer automa-\\ntion of order generation and execution. Programming high-frequency com-\\nputer systems requires advanced skills in software development. Run-time\\nmistakes can be very costly; therefore, human supervision of trading in\\nproduction remains essential to ensure that the system is running within', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='fed92400-7fb4-4350-bec9-76aef10a8d7a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc01 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 18:28 Printer: Yet to come\\nIntroduction 5\\nprespeciﬁed risk boundaries. Such discretion is embedded in human su-\\npervision. However, the intervention of the trader is limited to one decision\\nonly: whether the system is performing within prespeciﬁed bounds, and if\\nit is not, whether it is the right time to pull the plug.\\nFrom the operational perspective, the high speed and low transparency\\nof computer-driven decisions requires a particular comfort level with\\ncomputer-driven execution. This comfort level may be further tested by\\nthreats from Internet viruses and other computer security challenges that\\ncould leave a system paralyzed.\\nFinally, just staying in the high-frequency game requires ongoing main-\\ntenance and upgrades to keep up with the “arms race” of information tech-\\nnology (IT) expenditures by banks and other ﬁnancial institutions that are\\nallotted for developing the fastest computer hardware and execution en-\\ngines in the world.\\nOverall, high-frequency trading is a difﬁcult but proﬁtable endeavor\\nthat can generate stable proﬁts under various market conditions. Solid\\nfooting in both theory and practice of ﬁnance and computer science are\\nthe normal prerequisites for successful implementation of high-frequency\\nenvironments.

The ﬁfth and last\\npart addresses the issues of running, monitoring, and benchmarking high-\\nfrequency trading systems.\\nThe book includes numerous quantitative trading strategies with refer-\\nences to the studies that ﬁrst documented the ideas. The trading strate-\\ngies discussed illustrate practical considerations behind high-frequency\\ntrading. Chapter 10 considers strategies of the highest frequency, with\\nposition-holding periods of one minute or less. Chapter 11 looks into a class\\nof high-frequency strategies known as the market microstructure mod-\\nels, with typical holding periods seldom exceeding 10 minutes. Chapter 12\\ndetails strategies capturing abnormal returns around ad hoc events such\\nas announcements of economic ﬁgures. Such strategies, known as “event\\narbitrage” strategies, work best with positions held from 30 minutes to\\n1 hour. Chapter 13 addresses a gamut of other strategies collectively known\\nas “statistical arbitrage” with positions often held up to one trading day.\\nChapter 14 discusses the latest scientiﬁc thought in creating multistrategy\\nportfolios.\\nThe strategies presented are based on published academic research\\nand can be readily implemented by trading professionals. It is worth keep-\\ning in mind, however, that strategies made public soon become obsolete, as\\nmany people rush in to trade upon them, erasing the margin potential in the\\nprocess. As a consequence, the best-performing strategies are the ones that\\nare kept in the strictest of conﬁdence and seldom ﬁnd their way into the\\npress, this book being no exception.

While the\\nintroduction of new market securities, such as EUR/USD in 1999, created\\nlarge-scale one-time disruptions in market routines, technological changes\\nhave a subtle and continuous impact on the markets. Over the years, tech-\\nnology has improved the way news is disseminated, the quality of ﬁnan-\\ncial analysis, and the speed of communication among market participants.\\nWhile these changes have made the markets more transparent and reduced\\nthe number of traditional market inefﬁciencies, technology has also made\\navailable an entirely new set of arbitrage opportunities.\\nMany years ago, securities markets were run in an entirely manual\\nfashion.

The salesperson would\\nthen walk over or shout to the trading representative a request for prices\\non securities of interest to the client. The trader would report back the mar-\\nket prices obtained from other brokers and exchanges. The process would\\nrepeat itself when the client placed an order.\\nThe process was slow, error-prone, and expensive, with the costs being\\npassed on to the client. Most errors arose from two sources:\\n1. Markets could move signiﬁcantly between the time the market price\\nwas set on an exchange and the time the client received the quote.\\n2. Errors were introduced in multiple levels of human communication, as\\npeople misheard the market data being transmitted.\\nThe communication chain was as costly as it was unreliable, as all the\\nlinks in the human chain were compensated for their efforts and market\\nparticipants absorbed the costs of errors.\\nIt was not until the 1980s that the ﬁrst electronic dealing systems ap-\\npeared and were immediately heralded as revolutionary. The systems ag-\\ngregated market data across multiple dealers and exchanges, distributed\\ninformation simultaneously to a multitude of market participants, allowed\\nparties with preapproved credits to trade with each other at the best avail-\\nable prices displayed on the systems, and created reliable information\\nand transaction logs. According to Leinweber (2007), designated order\\nturnaround (DOT), introduced by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE),\\nwas the ﬁrst electronic execution system. DOT was accessible only to\\nNYSE ﬂoor specialists, making it useful only for facilitation of the NYSE’s\\ninternal operations. Nasdaq’s computer-assisted execution system, avail-\\nable to broker-dealers, was rolled out in 1983, with the small-order execu-\\ntion system following in 1984.\\nWhile computer-based execution has been available on selected ex-\\nchanges and networks since the mid-1980s, systematic trading did not gain\\ntraction until the 1990s. According to Goodhart and O’Hara (1997), the\\nmain reasons for the delay in adopting systematic trading were the high\\ncosts of computing as well as the low throughput of electronic orders on\\nmany exchanges. NASDAQ, for example, introduced its electronic execu-\\ntion capability in 1985, but made it available only for smaller orders of up\\nto 1,000 shares at a time. Exchanges such as the American Stock Exchange\\n(AMEX) and the NYSE developed hybrid electronic/ﬂoor markets that did\\nnot fully utilize electronic trading capabilities.\\nOnce new technologies are accepted by ﬁnancial institutions, their ap-\\nplications tend to further increase demand for automated trading.

As\\nFigure 2.1 shows, a notable rise in the number of systematic funds oc-\\ncurred in the early 1990s. Coincidentally, in 1992 the Chicago Mercantile\\nExchange (CME) launched its ﬁrst electronic platform, Globex. Initially,\\nGlobex traded only CME futures on the most liquid currency pairs:\\nDeutsche mark and Japanese yen. Electronic trading was subsequently ex-\\ntended to CME futures on British pounds, Swiss francs, and Australian and\\nCanadian dollars. In 1993, systematic trading was enabled for CME equity\\nfutures. By October 2002, electronic trading on the CME reached an aver-\\nage daily volume of 1.2 million contracts, and innovation and expansion of\\ntrading technology continued henceforth, causing an explosion in system-\\natic trading in futures along the way.\\nThe ﬁrst fully electronic U.S. options exchange was launched in 2000\\nby the New York–based International Securities Exchange (ISE). As of\\nmid-2008, seven exchanges offered either fully electronic or a hybrid mix\\nof ﬂoor and electronic trading in options. These seven exchanges are\\nISE, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), Boston Options Exchange\\n(BOX), AMEX, NYSE’s Arca Options, and Nasdaq Options Market (NOM).\\nAccording to estimates conducted by Boston-based Aite Group, shown\\nin Figure 2.2, adoption of electronic trading has grown from 25 percent of\\ntrading volume in 2001 to 85 percent in 2008. Close to 100 percent of equity\\ntrading is expected to be performed over the electronic networks by 2010.\\nTechnological developments markedly increased the daily trade vol-\\nume.

The traditional 20th-century network of ﬁnancial\\nservices is illustrated in Figure 2.3. At the core are the exchanges or, in the\\ncase of foreign exchange trading, inter-dealer networks. Exchanges are the\\ncentralized marketplaces for transacting and clearing securities orders. In\\ndecentralized foreign exchange markets, inter-dealer networks consist of\\ninter-dealer brokers, which, like exchanges, are organizations that ensure\\nliquidity in the markets and deal between their peers and broker-dealers.\\nBroker-dealers perform two functions—trading for their own accounts\\n(known as “proprietary trading” or “prop trading”) and transacting and\\nclearing trades for their customers. Broker-dealers use inter-dealer brokers\\nto quickly ﬁnd the best price for a particular security among the network of\\nother broker-dealers. Occasionally, broker-dealers also deal directly with\\nother broker-dealers, particularly for less liquid instruments such as cus-\\ntomized option contracts. Broker-dealers’ transacting clients are invest-\\nment banking clients (institutional clients), large corporations (corporate\\nclients), medium-sized ﬁrms (commercial clients), and high-net-worth in-\\ndividuals (HNW clients). Investment institutions can in turn be brokerages\\nproviding trading access to other, smaller institutions and individuals with\\nsmaller accounts (retail clients).\\nUntil the late 1990s, it was the broker-dealers who played the central\\nand most proﬁtable roles in the ﬁnancial ecosystem; broker-dealers con-\\ntrolled clients’ access to the exchanges and were compensated handsomely\\nfor doing so. Multiple layers of brokers served different levels of investors.\\nThe institutional investors, the well-capitalized professional investment\\noutﬁts, were served by the elite class of institutional sales brokers that\\nsought volume; the individual investors were assisted by the retail bro-\\nkers that charged higher commissions.

In “dark” liquidity pools, trader\\nidentities and orders remain anonymous.\\nIsland is one of the largest ECNs, which traded about 10 percent of\\nNASDAQ’s volume in 2002. On Island, all market participants can post\\ntheir limit orders anonymously.

Technical analysts sought to identify recurring patterns\\nin security prices. Many techniques used in technical analysis measure cur-\\nrent price levels relative to the rolling moving average of the price, or a\\ncombination of the moving average and standard deviation of the price.\\nFor example, a technical analysis technique known as moving average\\nconvergence divergence (MACD) uses three exponential moving averages\\nto generate trading signals. Advanced technical analysts may look at se-\\ncurity prices in conjunction with current market events or general market\\nconditions to obtain a fuller idea of where the prices may be moving next.\\nTechnical analysis prospered through the ﬁrst half of the 20th century,\\nwhen trading technology was in its telegraph and pneumatic-tube stages\\nand the trading complexity of major securities was considerably lower\\nthan it is today. The inability to transmit information quickly limited the\\nnumber of shares that changed hands, curtailed the pace at which infor-\\nmation was incorporated into prices, and allowed charts to display latent\\nsupply and demand of securities. The previous day’s trades appeared in\\nthe next morning’s newspaper and were often sufﬁcient for technical an-\\nalysts to successfully infer future movement of the prices based on pub-\\nlished information. In post-WWII decades, when trading technology began\\nto develop considerably, technical analysis developed into a self-fulﬁlling\\nprophecy.\\nIf, for example, enough people believed that a “head-and-shoulders”\\npattern would be followed by a steep sell-off in a particular instrument,\\nall the believers would place sell orders following a head-and-shoulders\\npattern, thus indeed realizing the prediction. Subsequently, institutional\\ninvestors began modeling technical patterns using powerful computer\\ntechnology, and trading them away before they became apparent to the\\nnaked eye. By now, technical analysis at low frequencies, such as daily or\\nweekly intervals, is marginalized to work only for the smallest, least liquid\\nsecurities, which are traded at very low frequencies—once or twice per day\\nor even per week. However, several researchers ﬁnd that technical analysis\\nstill has legs: Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992) ﬁnd that moving av-\\nerages can predict future abnormal returns, while Aldridge (2009a) shows', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2fa9520f-2235-4d4e-b6c3-a60bcb616028', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '28', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc02 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:3 Printer: Yet to come\\n14 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nthat moving averages, “stochastics” and relative strength indicators (RSI)\\nmay succeed in generating proﬁtable trading signals on intra-day data sam-\\npled at hourly intervals.\\nIn a way, technical analysis was a precursor of modern microstruc-\\nture theory. Even though market microstructure applies at a much higher\\nfrequency and with a much higher degree of sophistication than techni-\\ncal analysis, both market microstructure and technical analysis work to\\ninfer market supply and demand from past price movements. Much of the\\ncontemporary high-frequency trading is based on detecting latent market\\ninformation from the minute changes in the most recent price movements.\\nNot many of the predeﬁned technical patterns, however, work consistently\\nin the high-frequency environment. Instead, high-frequency trading models\\nare built on probability-driven econometric inferences, often incorporating\\nfundamental analysis.\\nFundamental analysis originated in equities, when traders noticed\\nthat future cash ﬂows, such as dividends, affected market price levels.\\nThe cash ﬂows were then discounted back to the present to obtain the\\nfair present market value of the security. Graham and Dodd (1934) were\\none of the earliest purveyors of the methodology and their approach is\\nstill popular. Over the years, the term fundamental analysis expanded\\nto include pricing of securities with no obvious cash ﬂows based on\\nexpected economic variables. For example, fundamental determination of\\nexchange rates today implies equilibrium valuation of the rates based on\\nmacroeconomic theories.\\nFundamental analysis developed through much of the 20th century.\\nToday, fundamental analysis refers to trading on the expectation that the\\nprices will move to the level predicted by supply and demand relation-\\nships, the fundamentals of economic theory. In equities, microeconomic\\nmodels apply; equity prices are still most often determined as present val-\\nues of future cash ﬂows. In foreign exchange, macroeconomic models are\\nmost prevalent; the models specify expected price levels using information\\nabout inﬂation, trade balances of different countries, and other macroeco-\\nnomic variables. Derivatives are traded fundamentally through advanced\\neconometric models that incorporate statistical properties of price move-\\nments of underlying instruments. Fundamental commodities trading ana-\\nlyzes and matches available supply and demand.\\nVarious facets of the fundamental analysis are active inputs into\\nmany high-frequency trading models, alongside market microstructure. For\\nexample, event arbitrage consists of trading the momentum response ac-\\ncompanying the price adjustment of the security in response to new fun-\\ndamental information. The date and time of the occurrence of the news\\nevent is typically known in advance, and the content of the news is usually\\nrevealed at the time of the news announcement.

These\\nwarriors, dubbed quants, developed advanced mathematical models that\\noften had little to do with the traditional old-school fundamental and tech-\\nnical thinking. The new quant models gave rise to “quant trading,” a math-\\nematical model–fueled trading methodology that was a radical departure\\nfrom established technical and fundamental trading styles. “Statistical ar-\\nbitrage” strategies (stat-arbfor short) became the new stars in the money-\\nmaking arena. As the news of great stat-arb performances spread, their\\ntechniques became widely popular, and the constant innovation arms race\\nensued; the people who kept ahead of the pack were likely to reap the\\nhighest gains.\\nThe most obvious aspect of competition was speed. Whoever was able\\nto run a quant model the fastest was the ﬁrst to identify and trade upon\\na market inefﬁciency and was the one to capture the biggest gain. To in-\\ncrease trading speed, traders began to rely on fast computers to make and\\nexecute trading decisions. Technological progress enabled exchanges to\\nadapt to the new technology-driven culture and offer docking convenient\\nfor trading. Computerized trading became known as “systematic trading”\\nafter the computer systems that processed run-time data and made and\\nexecuted buy-and-sell decisions.\\nHigh-frequency trading developed in the 1990s in response to advances\\nin computer technology and the adoption of the new technology by the\\nexchanges. From the original rudimentary order processing to the cur-\\nrent state-of-the-art all-inclusive trading systems, high-frequency trading\\nhas evolved into a billion-dollar industry.\\nTo ensure optimal execution of systematic trading, algorithms were\\ndesigned to mimic established execution strategies of traditional traders.\\nTo this day, the term “algorithmic trading” usually refers to the system-\\natic execution process—that is, the optimization of buy-and-sell decisions\\nonce these buy-and-sell decisions were made by another part of the system-\\natic trading process or by a human portfolio manager. Algorithmic trading\\nmay determine how to process an order given current market conditions:\\nwhether to execute the order aggressively (on a price close to the market\\nprice) or passively (on a limit price far removed from the current market\\nprice), in one trade or split into several smaller “packets.” As mentioned\\npreviously, algorithmic trading does not usually make portfolio allocation\\ndecisions; the decisions about when to buy or sell which securities are as-\\nsumed to be exogenous.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='39f09c83-8344-4964-bfd0-a205dc7fe1b2', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '30', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc02 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:3 Printer: Yet to come\\n16 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nHigh-frequency trading became a trading methodology deﬁned as quan-\\ntitative analysis embedded in computer systems processing data and mak-\\ning trading decisions at high speeds and keeping no positions overnight.\\nThe advances in computer technology over the past decades have en-\\nabled fully automated high-frequency trading, fueling the proﬁtability of\\ntrading desks and generating interest in pushing the technology even fur-\\nther. Trading desks seized upon cost savings realized from replacing ex-\\npensive trader headcount with less expensive trading algorithms along\\nwith other advanced computer technology. Immediacy and accuracy of\\nexecution and lack of hesitation offered by machines as compared with\\nhuman traders have also played a signiﬁcant role in banks’ decisions to\\nswitch away from traditional trading to systematic operations. Lack of\\novernight positions has translated into immediate savings due to reduction\\nin overnight position carry costs, a particular issue in crisis-driven tight\\nlending conditions or high-interest environments.\\nBanks also developed and adopted high-frequency functionality in re-\\nsponse to demand from buy-side investors. Institutional investors, in turn,\\nhave been encouraged to practice high-frequency trading by the inﬂux of\\ncapital following shorter lock-ups and daily disclosure to investors. Both\\ninstitutional and retail investors found that investment products based on\\nquantitative intra-day trading have little correlation with traditional buy-\\nand-hold strategies, adding pure return, or alpha, to their portfolios.\\nAs computer technology develops further and drops in price, high-\\nfrequency systems are bound to take on an even more active role. Special\\ncare should be taken, however, to distinguish high-frequency trading from\\nelectronic trading, algorithmic trading, and systematic trading. Figure 2.5\\nillustrates a schematic difference between high-frequency, systematic, and\\ntraditional long-term investing styles.\\nElectronic trading refers to the ability to transmit the orders electron-\\nically as opposed to telephone, mail, or in person. Since most orders in\\ntoday’s ﬁnancial markets are transmitted via computer networks, the term\\nelectronic trading is rapidly becoming obsolete.\\nAlgorithmic trading is more complex than electronic trading and can\\nrefer to a variety of algorithms spanning order-execution processes as well\\nas high-frequency portfolio allocation decisions. The execution algorithms\\nare designed to optimize trading execution once the buy-and-sell decisions\\nhave been made elsewhere. Algorithmic execution makes decisions about\\nthe best way to route the order to the exchange, the best point in time\\nto execute a submitted order if the order is not required to be executed\\nimmediately, and the best sequence of sizes in which the order should\\nbe optimally processed.

For example, algorithmic execution may\\ndetermine that a received order to buy 1,000,000 shares of IBM is best han-\\ndled using increments of 100 share lots to prevent a sudden run-up in the\\nprice. The decision fed to the execution algorithm, however, may or may\\nnot be high-frequency. An algorithm deployed to generate high-frequency\\ntrading signals, on the other hand, would generate the decision to buy the\\n1,000,000 shares of IBM. The high-frequency signals would then be passed\\non to the execution algorithm that would determine the optimal timing and\\nrouting of the order.\\nSuccessful implementation of high-frequency trading requires both\\ntypes of algorithms: those generating high-frequency trading signals and\\nthose optimizing execution of trading decisions. Algorithms designed for\\ngeneration of trading signals tend to be much more complex than those\\nfocusing on optimization of execution. Much of this book is devoted to\\nalgorithms used to generate high-frequency trading signals. Common al-\\ngorithms used to optimize trade execution in algorithmic trading are dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 18.\\nThe intent of algorithmic execution is illustrated by the results of a\\nTRADE Group survey.

In addition to the previously mentioned\\nfactors related to adoption of algorithmic trading, such as productivity and\\naccuracy of traders, the buy-side managers also reported their use of the\\nalgorithms to be driven by the anonymity of execution that the algorithmic\\ntrading permits. Stealth execution allows large investors to hide their\\ntrading intentions from other market participants, thus deﬂecting the\\npossibilities of order poaching and increasing overall proﬁtability.\\nSystematic trading refers to computer-driven trading positions that\\nmay be held a month or a day or a minute and therefore may or may not be\\nhigh-frequency. An example of systematic trading is a computer program\\nthat runs daily, weekly, or even monthly; accepts daily closing prices; out-\\nputs portfolio allocation matrices; and places buy-and-sell orders. Such a\\nsystem is not a high-frequency system.\\nTrue high-frequency trading systems make a full range of decisions,\\nfrom identiﬁcation of underpriced or overpriced securities, through opti-\\nmal portfolio allocation, to best execution. The distinguishing characteris-\\ntic of high-frequency trading is the short position holding times, one day or\\nshorter in duration, usually with no positions held overnight. Because of\\ntheir rapid execution nature, most high-frequency trading systems are fully\\nsystematic and are also examples of systematic and algorithmic trading.\\nAll systematic and algorithmic trading platforms, however, are not high-\\nfrequency.\\nAbility to execute a security order algorithmically is a prerequisite for\\nhigh-frequency trading in a given security.

As Figure 2.7 shows, equi-\\nties are closely followed by futures. Advances in algorithmic execution of\\nforeign exchange, options, and ﬁxed income, however, have been less visi-\\nble. As illustrated in Figure 2.7, the lag of ﬁxed income instruments can be\\nexplained by the relative tardiness of electronic trading development for\\nthem, given that many of them are traded OTC and are difﬁcult to synchro-\\nnize as a result.\\nWhile research dedicated to the performance of high-frequency trad-\\ning is scarce, due to the unavailability of system performance data rel-\\native to data on long-term buy-and-hold strategies, anecdotal evidence\\nsuggests that most computer-driven strategies are high-frequency strate-\\ngies. Systematic and algorithmic trading naturally lends itself to trading\\napplications demanding high speed and precision of execution, as well\\nas high-frequency analysis of volumes of tick data. Systematic trading, in\\nturn, has been shown to outperform human-led trading along several key\\nmetrics. Aldridge (2009b), for example, shows that systematic funds con-\\nsistently outperform traditional trading operations when performance is\\nmeasured by Jensen’s alpha (Jensen, 1968), a metric of returns designed to\\nmeasure the unique skill of trading by abstracting performance from broad\\nmarket inﬂuences. Aldridge (2009b) also shows that the systematic funds\\noutperform nonsystematic funds in raw returns in times of crisis.

Technical trading would then imply buying a security\\nthe price of which was deemed too low in technical analysis, and selling\\na security the price of which was deemed too high. Technical analysis can\\nbe applied at any frequency and can be perfectly suitable in high-frequency\\ntrading models.\\nFundamental trading is based on fundamental analysis. Fundamental\\nanalysis derives the equilibrium price levels, given available information\\nand economic equilibrium theories. As with technical trading, fundamen-\\ntal trading entails buying a security the price of which was deemed too\\nlow relative to its analytically determined fundamental value and selling a\\nsecurity the price of which is considered too high. Like technical trading,\\nfundamental trading can also be applied at any frequency, although price\\nformation or microstructure effects may result in price anomalies at ultra-\\nhigh frequencies.\\nFinally, quant (short for quantitative) trading refers to making port-\\nfolio allocation decisions based on scientiﬁc principles. These principles\\nmay be fundamental or technical or can be based on simple statistical re-\\nlationships. The main difference between quant analyses and technical or\\nfundamental styles is that quants use little or no discretionary judgments,\\nwhereas fundamental analysts may exercise discretion in rating the man-\\nagement of the company, for example, and technical analysts may “see”\\nvarious shapes appearing in the charts. Given the availability of data, quant\\nanalysis can be run in high-frequency settings.\\nQuant frameworks are best suited to high-frequency trading for one\\nsimple reason: high-frequency generation of orders leaves little time for\\ntraders to make subjective nonquantitative decisions and input them into\\nthe system. Aside from their inability to incorporate discretionary inputs,\\nhigh-frequency trading systems can run on quant analyses based on both\\ntechnical and fundamental models.\\nAlgorithmic, Systematic, Electronic,\\nor Low-Latency?\\nMuch confusion exists among the terms “high-frequency trading” and\\n“algorithmic,” “systematic,” “electronic,” and “low-latency” trading.\\nHigh-frequency trading refers to fast reallocation or turnover of trading\\ncapital. To ensure that such reallocation is feasible, most high-frequency\\ntrading systems are built as algorithmic trading systems that use complex\\ncomputer algorithms to analyze quote data, make trading decisions, and\\noptimize trade execution. All algorithms are run electronically and, there-\\nfore, automatically fall into the “electronic trading” subset.\\nWhile all algorithmic trading qualiﬁes as electronic trading, the reverse\\ndoes not have to be the case; many electronic trading systems only route', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0c35ffff-b3a1-4303-a1e0-c1361cf587e7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '38', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc03 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:8 Printer: Yet to come\\n24 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\norders that may or may not be placed algorithmically.

High-frequency, on\\nthe other hand, refers to the fast turnover of capital that may require low-\\nlatency execution capability. Low-latency can be a trading strategy in its\\nown right when the high speed of execution is used to arbitrage instanta-\\nneous price differences on the same security at different exchanges.\\nMARKET PARTICIPANTS\\nCompetitors\\nHigh-frequency trading ﬁrms compete with other investment management\\nﬁrms for quick access to market inefﬁciencies, for access to trading and\\noperations capital, and for recruiting of talented trading strategists.

By contrast, tradi-\\ntional proprietary trading businesses incur ﬁxed costs from the moment an\\nexperienced senior trader with a proven track record begins running the\\ntrading desk and training promising young apprentices, through the time\\nwhen the trained apprentices replace their masters.\\nFigure 3.3 illustrates the cost curves for rolling out computerized and\\ntraditional trading systems. The cost of traditional trading remains fairly\\nconstant through time. With the exception of trader “burn-outs” necessi-\\ntating hiring and training new trader staff, costs of stafﬁng the traditional\\ntrading desk do not change. Developing computerized trading systems,\\nhowever, requires an up-front investment that is costly in terms of labor\\nand time. One successful trading system takes on average 18 months to\\ndevelop. The costs of computerized trading decline as the system moves\\ninto production, ultimately requiring a small support staff that typically\\nincludes a dedicated systems engineer and a performance monitoring\\nagent.

This process of model veriﬁcation is referred to as “back-\\ntesting.” Standard back-testing practices require that the tests be run on\\ndata of at least two years in duration. The typical modeling process is illus-\\nt r a t e di nF i g u r e3 . 4 .\\nSystem Implementation\\nThe models are often built in computer languages such as MatLab that pro-\\nvide a wide range of modeling tools but may not be suited perfectly for\\nhigh-speed applications. Thus, once the econometric relationships are as-\\ncertained, the relationships are programmed for execution in a fast com-\\nputer language such as C++. Subsequently, the systems are tested in\\n“paper-trading” with make-believe capital to ensure that the systems work\\nas intended and any problems (known as “bugs”) are identiﬁed and ﬁxed.\\nOnce the systems are indeed performing as expected, they are switched to\\nlive capital, where they are closely monitored to ensure proper execution\\nand proﬁtability.\\nHigh-frequency execution systems tend to be complex entities that de-\\ntect and react to a variety of market conditions.

Once the planning phase is com-\\nplete, the process moves into the analysis phase, where the scope of the\\ninitial iteration of the project is determined, feedback from all the rele-\\nvant stakeholders is aggregated, and senior management signs off on the\\nhigh-level project speciﬁcations. The next stage—the design—breaks the\\nsystem into manageable modules, outlines the functionality of each mod-\\nule, and speciﬁes the desired behavior. In the following stage (known as\\nthe implementation stage) the modules are programmed by teams of dedi-\\ncated software engineers and are tested against speciﬁcations determined\\nin the design stage. Once behavior is found to be satisfactory, the project\\nmoves into the production and maintenance phase, where deviations from\\nthe desired behavior are addressed. When the project is considered sta-\\nble, a new iteration of planning begins to incorporate enhancements and\\nother desired features into the project. See Chapter 16 for the details of\\nbest practices in design and implementation of the high-frequency trading\\nsystems.\\nTrading Platform\\nMost high-frequency trading systems today are built to be “platform-\\nindependent”—that is, to incorporate ﬂexible interfaces to multiple broker-\\ndealers, ECNs, and even exchanges. The independence is accomplished\\nthrough the use of FIX language, a special sequence of codes optimized for\\nexchange of ﬁnancial trading data. With FIX, at a ﬂip of a switch the trading\\nrouting can be changed from one executing broker to another or to several\\nbrokers simultaneously.\\nRisk Management\\nCompetent risk management is key to the success of any high-frequency\\ntrading system. A seemingly harmless glitch in the code, market data, mar-\\nket conditions, or the like can throw off the trading dynamic and result in\\nlarge losses. The objective of risk management is to assess the extent of\\npotential damages and to create infrastructure to mitigate damaging con-\\nditions during the system run-time.

The business of high-frequency trading is\\nno exception. Accounting for trading costs, a portion of revenues (80 per-\\ncent on average) is paid out to investors in the trading operation, leaving\\nthe management with “performance fees.” In addition, the management\\nmay collect “management fees,” which are a ﬁxed percentage of assets des-\\nignated to cover administrative expenses of the trading business regardless\\nof performance.\\nEven the most cost-effective high-frequency trading operation has em-\\nployee salaries, administrative services, and trading costs, as well as legal\\nand compliance expenses. The expenses easily run $100,000 per average\\nemployee in base salaries and beneﬁts, not considering a negotiated incen-\\ntive structure; this is in addition to the ﬁxed cost overhead of ofﬁce space\\nand related expenses.\\nTo compensate for these expenses, what is the minimum level of re-\\nturn on capital that a high-frequency manager should generate each year\\nto remain a going concern? The answer depends on the leverage of the\\ntrading platform. Consider a trading operation with ﬁve employees. Fixed\\nexpenses of such a business may total $600,000 per year, including salaries\\nand ofﬁce expenses. Suppose further that the business charges a 0.5 per-\\ncent management fee on its capital equity and a 20 percent incentive fee\\non returns it produces above the previous high value, or “watermark.” The\\nminimum capital/return conditions for breaking even for such a trading\\nbusiness under different leverage situations are shown in Figure 3.7. As il-\\nlustrated there, a $20 million unlevered fund with ﬁve employees needs to\\ngenerate at least a 12 percent return per year in order to break even, while\\nthe same fund levered 500 percent (borrowing four times its investment\\nequity) needs to generate just 3 percent per year to survive.\\nConventional wisdom, however, tells us that leverage increases the\\nrisk of losses. To evaluate the risk associated with higher leverage, we\\nnext consider the risks of losing at least 20 percent of the capital equity\\nof the business. As shown in Figures 3.7 and 3.8, the probability of severe\\nlosses is much more dependent on the aggregate Sharpe ratio of the trading\\nstrategies than it is on the leverage used by the hedge fund.\\nThe Sharpe ratio of a high-frequency trading strategy, discussed in de-\\ntail in Chapter 5, is the ratio of the average annualized return of the strategy\\nto the annualized standard deviation of the strategy’s returns.

Some securities markets, how-\\never, are more appropriate than others. This chapter examines the\\ntopic of market suitability for high-frequency trading.\\nTo be appropriate for this type of trading, two requirements must be\\nmet: the ability to quickly move in and out of positions and sufﬁcient mar-\\nket volatility to ensure that changes in prices exceed transaction costs. The\\nvolatilities of different markets have been shown to be highly interrelated\\nand dependent on the volume of macroeconomic news reaching the mar-\\nkets. The ability to quickly enter into positions as well as to close them\\nis in turn determined by two factors: market liquidity and availability of\\nelectronic execution.\\nLiquid assets are characterized by readily available supply and de-\\nmand. Liquid securities such as major foreign exchange pairs are traded\\n24 hours a day, 5 days a week. Less liquid securities, such as penny stocks,\\nmay trade only once every few days. Between trades, the prices on illiquid\\nassets may change substantially, making less liquid securities more risky\\nas compared with more liquid assets.\\nHigh-frequency strategies focus on the most liquid securities; a security\\nrequiring a holding period of 10 minutes may not be able to ﬁnd a timely\\ncounterparty in illiquid markets. While longer-horizon investors can work\\nwith either liquid or illiquid securities, Amihud and Mendelson (1986) show\\nthat longer-horizon investors optimally hold less liquid assets.

Market liquidity depends on the presence of trading counterparties\\nin the market, as well as the counterparties’ willingness to trade. The mar-\\nket participants’ willingness to trade in turn depends on their risk aversions\\nand expectations of impending price movements, along with other market\\ninformation.\\nOne way to compare the liquidity of different securities is to use the\\naverage daily volume of each security as the measure of liquidity. In terms\\nof daily average trading volume, foreign exchange is the most liquid mar-\\nket, followed by recently issued U.S. Treasury securities; then come equi-\\nties, options, commodities, and futures. Of the most liquid securities, only\\nspot foreign exchange, equities, options, and futures markets have enabled\\nfully automated execution; the remaining markets still tend to negotiate\\non a contract-by-contract basis over the counter (OTC), slowing down the\\ntrading process. Table 4.1 enumerates current market volumes and exe-\\ncution methods for different securities. As the demand for high-frequency\\ntrading increases, the development of electronic trading in the OTC mar-\\nkets may prove highly proﬁtable. Figure 4.1 graphically illustrates optimal\\ntrading frequencies for various securities where the optimal trading fre-\\nquency is a function of available market liquidity. The following sections\\ndiscuss the pros and cons of high-frequency trading in each security market\\nin detail.\\nFINANCIAL MARKETS AND\\nTHEIR SUITABILITY FOR\\nHIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nThis section discusses the availability of various ﬁnancial markets for high-\\nfrequency trading.

The interest rate market trades short- and long-term deposits, and\\nthe bond market trades publicly issued debt obligations. Interest rate prod-\\nucts and bonds are similar in that they both pay ﬁxed or prespeciﬁed in-\\ncome to their holders. Aside from their ﬁxed-income quality, bonds and\\ninterest rate products exhibit little similarity.\\nBoth interest rate and bond markets use spot, futures, and swap con-\\ntracts. Spot trading in both interest rate products and bonds implies instan-\\ntaneous or “on-the-spot” delivery and transfer of possession of the traded\\nsecurity. Futures trading denotes delivery and transfer of possession at a\\nprespeciﬁed date. Swap trading is a contractual transfer of cash ﬂows be-\\ntween two parties. Interest rate swaps may specify swapping of a ﬁxed rate\\nfor a ﬂoating rate; bond swaps refer mostly to a trading strategy whereby\\nthe investor sells one bond and buys another at a comparable price, but\\nwith different characteristics.\\nIn ﬁxed-income markets, many investors are focused on the product\\npayouts rather than on the prices of the investments themselves. High-\\nfrequency traders taking advantage of short-term price deviations win, as\\ndo longer-term investors.\\nInterest Rate Markets The spot interest rate market comprises\\nquotes offered by banks to other banks, and can be known as “spot in-\\nterest rates,” “cash interest rates,” or “interbank interest rates.” As other\\nﬁnancial products, interbank interest rates are quoted as a bid and an ask.\\nA bid interest rate is quoted to banks wanting to make a deposit, whereas\\nthe ask quote is offered to banks to take a credit.\\nThe quoted interest rates are not necessarily the rates at which banks\\nlend each other money. The actual lending rate is the quoted interest rate\\nplus a credit spread, where the credit spread is the amount that compen-\\nsates the lending bank for the risk it takes while lending. The risk of the\\nlending bank in turn depends on the creditworthiness of the borrowing\\nbank. The lower the creditworthiness of the borrowing bank, the higher the\\nrisk that the lending bank takes by lending out the money, and the higher\\nthe credit spread intended to compensate the lending bank for the risk of\\nlending.\\nSpot interest rates have ﬁxed maturity periods denominated in days or\\nmonths. Current maturity periods constitute the following set:\\nr Overnight: O/N\\nr The next business day after tomorrow, known as “tomorrow next”: T/N\\nr One week: S/W', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1b34bb4a-7f5e-42f6-87ce-f3638004e086', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '55', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc04 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:52 Printer: Yet to come\\nFinancial Markets Suitable for High-Frequency Trading 41\\nr One month: 1M\\nr Two months: 2M\\nr Three months: 3M\\nr Six months: 6M\\nr Nine months: 9M\\nr One year: 1Y\\nInterest rate futures are contracts to buy and sell underlying interest\\nrates in the future. Short-term interest rate futures are more liquid than\\nspot interest rate futures. The liquidity of the interest rate futures market is\\nreﬂected in the bid-ask spread of the interest rate futures; a bid-ask spread\\non interest rate futures is on average one-tenth of the bid-ask spread on the\\nunderlying spot interest rate.\\nInterest rate futures are commonly based on the 3-month deposit rate.\\nThe actual quotation for a futures bid or ask prices, fbid and fask, respec-\\ntively, depends on the annualized bid or ask OTC forward rates, rbid and\\nrask, as follows:\\nfbid = 100\\n(\\n1 − rbid\\n100%\\n)\\nfask = 100\\n(\\n1 − rask\\n100%\\n)\\nA 3-percent forward rate, for example, results in a futures price of 97.00.\\nThe forward rates underlying the futures contracts typically mature in\\nthree months. The futures contracts usually have four standardized set-\\ntlements per year—in March, June, September, and December.\\nUnlike spot interest rates, interest rate futures do not vary according\\nto the creditworthiness of the borrower. Instead of pricing default risk\\ninto the rate explicitly, exchanges trading interest rate futures require bor-\\nrowers to post collateral accounts that reﬂect the creditworthiness of the\\nborrower.\\nSwap products are the most populous interest rate category, yet most\\nstill trade OTC. Selected swap products have made inroads into electronic\\ntrading. CME Group, for example, has created electronic programs for 30-\\nday Fed Funds futures and CBOT 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year interest rate\\nswap futures; 30-day Fed Funds options; 2-year, 5-year and 10-year Trea-\\nsury note options; and Treasury bond options. As Table 4.2 shows, how-\\never, electronic trading volumes of interest rate products remain limited.\\nBond Markets Bonds are publicly issued debt obligations.

For example, a company in the midst\\nof a turmoil may decide to issue bonds that embed an option to convert\\nthe bond into the company’s stock at some later date. Such a bond type is\\nknown as a convertible bond and is designed to give prospective investors\\nthe security of preferred redemptions should the company be liquidated;\\nshould the company fully recover, the bond gives investors the ability to\\nconvert it into equity and thus obtain a higher return in the long run.

Foreign exchange trading originated in 1971\\nwhen the gold standard collapsed under the heft of U.S. debt. From 1971\\nuntil the late 1980s, foreign exchange traded entirely among commercial\\nbanks that made deposit arrangements in different currencies. Commercial\\nbanks had exclusive access to inter-dealer networks, consisting of loose\\ngroups of third-party agents facilitating quick distribution of orders among\\ndifferent commercial banking clients. Investment banks, such as Goldman\\nSachs, had no direct access to the inter-dealer networks and transacted\\ntheir foreign exchange trades through commercial banks instead.\\nIn the early 1990s, investment banks were able to gain access to broker-\\ndealer networks. In the late 1990s non-bank companies and non–U.S. in-\\nvestment banks connected directly to the inter-dealer pools. Since 2003,\\nhedge funds and proprietary trading funds have also been granted access\\nto the inter-dealer liquidity. Currently, spot, forward, and swap foreign ex-\\nchange products trade through this decentralized and unregulated mecha-\\nnism. Only foreign exchange futures and selected options contracts can be\\nfound on exchanges.\\nThe decentralization of foreign exchange trading has had two key con-\\nsequences: the absence of “one price” and the absence of volume measures.\\nThe absence of a single coherent price at any given time is a direct\\nconsequence of decentralization. Different dealers receive different infor-\\nmation and price their securities accordingly. The lack of one price can\\npresent substantial arbitrage opportunities at high trading frequencies. An-\\nother consequence of decentralization is that the market-wide measure of\\nvolume at any given time in foreign exchange is not available. To monitor\\ndevelopments in foreign exchange markets, central banks conduct ﬁnan-\\ncial institution surveys every three years. These surveys are then aggre-\\ngated and published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\\nBIS estimates that the total foreign exchange (FX) market in 2007 had\\na daily trading volume of $3 trillion.

The spot market accounts for about\\n33 percent of the total daily turnover or about $1 trillion. According to\\nBIS Triennial Surveys, the proportion of spot transactions among all FX\\ntrades has been decreasing; in 1989, spot represented 59 percent of all FX\\ntrades. In 1998, spot accounted for only 40 percent of all FX trades. Of the\\n$2 trillion of daily FX volume that is not spot, $1.7 trillion is contributed\\nby FX swaps.\\nSome FX futures and options are traded on exchanges. Table 4.4 shows\\ndaily electronic trading volumes in most common foreign exchange futures\\non CME.\\nForeign exchange markets proﬁtably accommodate three types of\\nplayers with distinct goals: high-frequency traders, longer-term investors,\\nand corporations. The main objective of high-frequency traders is to cap-\\nture small intra-day price changes. The main objective of longer-term in-\\nvestors is to gain from global macro changes. Finally, the main objective\\nof corporate currency managers is usually hedging of cross-border ﬂows\\nagainst adverse currency movements—for example, a Canadian ﬁrm sell-\\ning in the United States may choose to hedge its revenue stream by pur-\\nchasing puts on USD/CAD futures. The ﬂows of the three parties can be\\nquite distinct, as Table 4.5 illustrates.\\nTable 4.5 reports summary statistics for EUR/USD order ﬂows ob-\\nserved by Citibank and sampled at the weekly frequency between Jan-\\nuary 1993 and July 1999: A) statistics for weekly EUR/USD order ﬂow\\naggregated across Citibank’s corporate, trading, and investing customers;\\nand B) order ﬂows from end-user segments cumulated over a week.

Many\\ndifferent metrics have been developed over time to illuminate a strat-\\negy’s performance. This chapter summarizes the most popular ap-\\nproaches for performance measurement and discusses strategy capacity\\nand the length of time required to evaluate a strategy.\\nBASIC RETURN CHARACTERISTICS\\nTrading strategies may come in all shapes and sizes, but they share one\\ncharacteristic that makes comparison across different strategies feasible—\\nreturn.\\nThe return itself, however, can be measured across a wide array of\\nfrequencies: hourly, daily, monthly, quarterly, and annually, among others.\\nCare should be exercised to ensure that all returns used for inter-strategy\\ncomparisons are generated at the same frequency.\\nReturns of individual strategies can be compared using a variety of per-\\nformance measures. Average annual return is one such metric. An average\\nreturn value is a simplistic summary of the location of the mean of the re-\\nturn distribution. Higher average returns may be potentially more desirable\\nthan lower returns; however, the average return itself says nothing about\\ndispersion of the distribution of returns around its mean, a measure that\\ncan be critical for risk-averse investors.\\nVolatility of returns measures the dispersion of returns around the av-\\nerage return; it is most often computed as the standard deviation of returns.\\n49', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c25e422b-a1d5-434c-a406-b2105acb68b5', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '64', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc05 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:17 Printer: Yet to come\\n50 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nVolatility, or standard deviation, is often taken to proxy risk. Standard devi-\\nation, however, summarizes the average deviation from the mean and does\\nnot account for the risk of extreme negative effects that can wipe out years\\nof performance.\\nA measure of tail risk popular among practitioners that documents the\\nmaximum severity of losses observed in historical data is maximum draw-\\ndown. Maximum drawdown records the lowest peak-to-trough return from\\nthe last global maximum to the minimum that occurred prior to the next\\nglobal maximum that supersedes the last global maximum. The global max-\\nimum measured on the past data at any point in time is known as “high\\nwater mark.” A drawdown is then the lowest return in between two suc-\\ncessive high water marks. The lowest drawdown is known as the maximum\\ndrawdown.\\nFigure 5.1 illustrates the concepts of high water mark and maximum\\ndrawdown graphically. The graph presents an evolution of a sample cu-\\nmulative return of a particular investment model over time. At timetA,t h e\\nreturn RA is the highest cumulative return documented on the chart, so it is\\nour high water mark at time tA. The cumulative return subsequently drops\\nto level RB at time tB, but the value of our high water mark remains the\\nsame: RA. Since RB at time tB presents the lowest drop in cumulative re-\\nturn on record, the value (R B − RA) constitutes our maximum drawdown\\nat time tB.\\nSubsequently, the model reaches a new high water mark at time tA’\\nas soon as the cumulative return reached passes the previous high water\\nmarkRA. The value of the high water mark continues to increase until point\\nC, where it reaches a peak value to date: RC. At this point, the maximum\\ndrawdown remains (RB − RA).\\nCumulative Return\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nD\\nE\\nF\\nG\\ntA tB tC tD tE tF tG time\\nRG\\nRC\\nRE\\nRA\\nRB\\nRF\\nRD\\ntA’\\nFIGURE 5.1 Calculation of maximum drawdowns.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a4da8a23-0a6e-4e9a-8a76-226ec6059fc8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '65', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc05 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:17 Printer: Yet to come\\nEvaluating Performance of High-Frequency Strategies 51\\nFollowing point C, the cumulative return drops considerably, reaching\\nprogressively lower troughs. The new maximum drawdown is computed\\nat a point X as soon as the following condition holds: RX − RC < RB −\\nRA. Point C and the corresponding cumulative return RC remain the high\\nwater mark until it is exceeded at point G. Point D sets the new maximum\\ndrawdown ( RD − RC ) that remains in effect for the duration of the time\\nshown in the graph.\\nThe average return, volatility, and maximum drawdown over a pre-\\nspeciﬁed window of time measured at a predeﬁned frequency are the main-\\nstays of performance comparison and reporting for different trading strate-\\ngies. In addition to the average return, volatility, and maximum drawdown,\\npractitioners sometimes quote skewness and kurtosis of returns when de-\\nscribing the shape of their return distributions. As usual, skewness illus-\\ntrates the position of the distribution relative to the return average; positive\\nskewness indicates prevalence of positive returns, while negative skew-\\nness indicates that a large proportion of returns is negative. Kurtosis indi-\\ncates whether the tails of the distribution are normal; high kurtosis signiﬁes\\n“fat tails,” a higher than normal probability of extreme positive or negative\\nevents.\\nCOMPARATIVE RATIOS\\nWhile average return, standard deviation, and maximum drawdown\\npresent a picture of the performance of a particular trading strategy, the\\nmeasures do not lend to an easy point comparison among two or more\\nstrategies. Several comparative performance metrics have been developed\\nin an attempt to summarize mean, variance, and tail risk in a single number\\nthat can be used to compare different trading strategies. Table 5.1 summa-\\nrizes the most popular point measures.\\nThe ﬁrst generation of point performance measures were devel-\\noped in the 1960s and include the Sharpe ratio, Jensen’s alpha, and the\\nTreynor ratio. The Sharpe ratio is probably the most widely used mea-\\nsure in comparative performance evaluation; it incorporates three desir-\\nable metrics—average return, standard deviation, and the cost of capital.\\nThe Sharpe ratio was designed in 1966 by William Sharpe, later a win-\\nner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics; it is a remarkably enduring\\nconcept used in the study and practice of ﬁnance. A textbook deﬁnition of\\nthe Sharpe ratio is SR =\\n¯R−RF\\nσR\\n, where ¯R is the annualized average return\\nfrom trading, σR is the annualized standard deviation of trading returns,\\nand RF is the risk-free rate (e.g., Fed Funds) that is included to capture\\nthe opportunity cost as well as the position carrying costs associated with', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='644fd750-36bf-4cdb-9a37-954988c4636d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '66', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc05 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:17 Printer: Yet to come\\n52 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nTABLE 5.1 Performance Measure Summary\\nSharpe Ratio\\n(Sharpe\\n[1966])\\nSR = E[r]−rf\\nσ[r] ,w h e r e\\nE[r] = r1+···+rT\\nT\\nσ[r] =\\n√\\n(r1−E[r])2+···+(rT −E[r])2\\nT−1\\nThe Sharpe ratio of\\nhigh-frequency trading\\nstrategies: SR = E[r]\\nσ[r]\\nAdequate if returns are\\nnormally distributed.\\nTreynor Ratio\\n(Treynor\\n[1965])\\nTreynori = E[ri ]−rf\\nβi\\nβi is the regression\\ncoeﬃcient of trading\\nreturns on returns of the\\ninvestor’s reference\\nportfolio, such as the\\nmarket portfolio.\\nAdequate if returns are\\nnormally distributed and the\\ninvestor wishes to split his\\nholdings between one trading\\nstrategy and the market\\nportfolio.\\nJensen’s\\nAlpha\\n(Jensen\\n[1968])\\nαi = E[ri ] − rf − βi (rM − rf )\\nβi is the regression\\ncoeﬃcient of trading\\nreturns on returns of the\\ninvestor’s reference\\nportfolio, such as the\\nmarket portfolio.\\nMeasures trading return in\\nexcess of the return predicted\\nby CAPM.

Surprisingly, the Sharpe ratio\\nis an effective metric for selecting mean-variance efﬁcient securities.\\nConsider Figure 5.2, for example, which illustrates the classic mean-\\nvariance frontier. In the ﬁgure, the Sharpe ratio is the slope of the line em-\\nanating from the risk-free rate and passing through a point corresponding\\nto a given portfolio (M for market portfolio), or trading strategy, or individ-\\nual security. The bold line tangent to the mean-variance set of all portfolio\\ncombinations is the efﬁcient frontier itself.

The Calmar ratio, Sterling ratio, and\\nBurke ratio do precisely that. The Calmar ratio, developed by Young (1991),\\nuses the maximum drawdown as the measure of volatility. The Sterling\\nratio, ﬁrst described by Kestner (1996), uses the average drawdown as a\\nproxy for volatility. Finally, the Burke ratio, developed by Burke (1994),\\nuses the standard deviation of maximum drawdowns as a volatility metric.\\nIn addition to ignoring the tail risk, the Sharpe ratio is also frequently\\ncriticized for including positive returns in the volatility measure. The argu-\\nment goes that only the negative returns are meaningful when estimating\\nand comparing performance of trading strategies. In response, a “Greek”\\nclass of ratios extended the Sharpe ratio by replacing volatility with the av-\\nerage metrics of adverse returns only. These adverse return metrics are\\nknown as lower partial moments (LPMs) and are computed as regular\\nmoments of a distribution (i.e., mean, standard deviation, and skewness),\\nexcept that the data used in computation comprises returns below a speci-\\nﬁed benchmark only. Thus, a metric known as Omega, developed by Shad-\\nwick and Keating (2002) and Kaplan and Knowles (2004), replaces the\\nstandard deviation of returns in the Sharpe ratio calculation with the ﬁrst\\nlower partial moment, the average of the returns that fell below the se-\\nlected benchmark. The Sortino ratio, developed by Sortino and van der\\nMeer (1991), uses the standard deviation of the returns that fell short of the\\nbenchmark, the second LPM, as a measure of return volatility in the Sharpe\\nratio calculation. The Kappa 3 measure, developed by Kaplan and Knowles\\n(2004), replaces the standard deviation in the Sharpe ratio with the third\\nLPM of the returns, the skewness of the returns below the benchmark. Fi-\\nnally, the Upside Potential ratio, produced by Sortino, van der Meer, and\\nPlantinga (1999), measures the average return above the benchmark (the\\nﬁrst higher partial moment) per unit of standard deviation of returns below\\nthe benchmark.\\nValue-at-risk (VaR) measures also gained considerable popularity as\\nmetrics able to summarize the tail risk in a convenient point format within\\na statistical framework. The VaR measure essentially identiﬁes the 90 per-\\ncent, 95 percent, or 99 percent Z-score cutoff in distribution of returns (the\\nmetric is also often used on real dollar distributions of daily proﬁt and loss).\\nVaR companion measure, the conditional VaR (CVaR), also known as ex-\\npected loss (EL), measures the average value of return within the cut-off\\ntail. Of course, the original VaR assumes normal distributions of returns,\\nwhereas the returns are known to be fat-tailed. To address this issue, a\\nmodiﬁed VaR (MVaR) measure was proposed by Gregoriou and Gueyie\\n(2003) and takes into account deviations from normality. Gregoriou and\\nGueyie (2003) also suggest using MVaR in place of standard deviation in\\nSharpe ratio calculations.\\nHow do these performance metrics stack up against each other?

In a nutshell, performance attribution notes that\\nt-period return on strategy i that invests into individual securities with re-\\nturns rjt in period t,w i t hj= 1, ... , J, has an underlying factor structure:\\nRit =\\n∑\\nj\\nxjtrjt (5.1)\\nwhere xjt is the relative weight of the jth ﬁnancial security in the portfolio\\nat time t, ∑\\nj\\nxjt = 1. The jth ﬁnancial security, in turn, has a period-t return\\nthat can be explained by K systematic factors:\\nrjt =\\n∑\\nk\\nλjk Fkt + εjt (5.2)\\nwhere Fkt is one of K underlying systematic factors in period t, k = 1, ... ,\\nK, λ is the factor loading, and εjt is the security j idiosyncratic return in pe-\\nriod t. Following Sharpe (1992), factors can be assumed to be broad asset\\nclasses, as well as individual stocks or other securities. Combining equa-\\ntions (1) and (2) we can express returns as follows:\\nRit =\\n∑\\nj,k\\nxjt λjk Fkt +\\n∑\\nj\\nxjt εjt (5.3)\\nreducing the large number of ﬁnancial securities potentially underlying\\nstrategyi’s returns to a small group of global factors.

The capacity of individ-\\nual strategies can be estimated through estimation of market impact, dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 19.

In addition, per\\nBrown, Goetzmann, and Park (2004), strategy capacity may depend on a\\nmanager’s skills. Furthermore, strategy capacity is a function of trading\\ncosts and asset liquidity, as shown by Getmansky, Lo, and Makarov (2004).\\nAs a result, Ding et al. (2008) conjecture that when the amount of capi-\\ntal deployed is lower than the strategy capacity, the strategy performance\\nmay be positively related to its capitalization. However, once capitalization\\nexceeds strategy capacity, performance becomes negatively related to the\\namount of capital involved.\\nLength of the Evaluation Period\\nfor High-Frequency Strategies\\nMost portfolio managers face the following question in evaluating candi-\\ndate trading strategies for inclusion in their portfolios: how long does one\\nneed to monitor a strategy in order to gain conﬁdence that the strategy\\nproduces the Sharpe ratio advertised?\\nSome portfolio managers have adopted an arbitrarily long evaluation\\nperiod: six months to two years. Some investors require a track record of at\\nleast six years. Yet others are content with just one month of daily perfor-\\nmance data. It turns out that, statistically, any of the previously mentioned\\ntime frames is correct if it is properly matched with the Sharpe ratio it\\nis intended to verify. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the shorter the strategy\\nevaluation period needed to ascertain the validity of the Sharpe ratio.\\nIf returns of the trading strategy can be assumed to be normal, Job-\\nson and Korkie (1981) showed that the error in Sharpe ratio estimation is\\nnormally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation\\ns = [(1/T)(1 + 0.5SR2)]1/2\\nFor a 90 percent conﬁdence level, the claimed Sharpe ratio should be\\nat least 1.645 times greater than the standard deviation of the Sharpe ratio\\nerrors, s.

For example, if a mar-\\nket order to sell 100,000 shares of SPY arrives at an exchange, and the ex-\\nchange has the following buy orders outstanding from best to worst: 10,000\\nshares at $935, 40,000 shares at $930, and 50,000 at $925, then the arriving\\nmarket sell order is “walked through the order book” until it is ﬁlled: the\\nﬁrst 10,000 shares are sold at $935, the next 40,000 shares at $930 and the\\nﬁnal 50,000 shares at $925, capturing the weighted-average price of $928\\nper share:\\nP = 10,000 × $935 + 40,000 × $930 + 50,000 × $925\\n100,000 = $928\\nTransaction costs, such as the broker-dealer and exchange fees, are ac-\\ncounted for separately, further reducing the proﬁtability of the trade. For\\ndetails on cost types and values, please see Chapter 19.\\nLimit orders are executed at a speciﬁed limit price or at a better price,\\nif one is available. When a limit order arrives at an exchange or an ECN,\\nthe order is ﬁrst compared with the best available opposite orders to de-\\ntermine whether the newly arrived order can be ﬁlled immediately. For\\nexample, when a limit order to sell SPY at 930 arrives at an exchange, the\\nexchange ﬁrst checks whether the exchange already has matching orders\\nto buy SPY at or above 930. If orders to buy SPY at 930 or at a higher price\\nare present, the arriving order is treated as a regular market order; it is\\nﬁlled immediately and charged the market order fees. If no matching or-\\nders exist, the arriving limit order is placed in the limit order book, where\\nit remains until it becomes the best available order and is matched with an\\nincoming market order.\\nThe aggregate size of limit orders available in the limit order book is\\noften thought to be the liquidity of the market. The total size of limit orders\\navailable at a particular price is referred to as the market depth. The num-\\nber of different price points at which limit orders exist in the limit order\\nbook is known as the breadth of the market. Figure 6.1 illustrates compo-\\nnents of the liquidity in the limit order book, according to Bervas (2006).\\nLimit orders can be seen as pre-commitments to buy or sell a speciﬁed\\nnumber of shares of a particular security at a prespeciﬁed price, whereas\\nmarket orders are requests to trade the speciﬁed quantity of a given se-\\ncurity as soon as possible at the best price available in the market. As\\na result, market orders execute fast, with certainty, at uncertain prices\\nand relatively high transaction costs.

The better-informed trader then jumps at the opportunity\\nto sell the security to the limit trader, leaving the limit trader in a losing\\nposition.\\nDespite the seeming lack of proﬁtability of limit order traders, limit\\ntrading has prospered. Most exchanges now offer limit order capabilities,\\nand limit order–based exchange alternatives known as the electronic com-\\nmunication networks (ECNs) experience a boom. The ability of exchanges\\nand ECNs to attract numerous limit order traders suggests that limit order\\ntrading is proﬁtable for many market participants.\\nHanda and Schwartz (1996) examine the proﬁtability of limit order\\ntraders, also known as liquidity traders, and ﬁnd that limit order strategies\\ncan capture economic rents in excess of market order strategies. Specif-\\nically, Handa and Schwartz (1996) ﬁnd that the buy limit order strategies\\nallow limit traders to obtain a premium of 0.1 percent to 1.6 percent per\\ntrade on average, depending on the type of the limit order strategy. Handa\\nand Schwartz (1996) consider four types of buy limit order strategies: those\\nwith buy limit orders placed at prices 0.5 percent, 1 percent, 2 percent, and\\n3 percent below the corresponding market price.\\nTo measure the proﬁtability of limit order trades, Handa and Schwartz\\n(1996) conducted the following experiment:\\nr The authors break down the trading data into equally spaced proﬁtabil-\\nity evaluation periods.\\nr In every evaluation period, the simulated market trader executes all\\ntrades at the opening price of the evaluation period.\\nr The limit order trader sets limit orders at prices x percent below the\\nmarket opening price.\\nr The limit order is considered executed when it is crossed by the market\\nprice.\\nr If the limit orders are not executed within the evaluation period, the\\nlimit trader is forced to execute his orders at the opening price of the\\nnext evaluation period.\\nHanda and Schwartz (1996) measure the proﬁtability of the limit order\\nstrategy as the average difference between the prices obtained using the\\nlimit order strategy and the prices obtained using the market order strategy\\nduring each evaluation period.\\nThe limit order strategy is proﬁtable if the average cost of realized limit\\norders is lower than that of realized market orders.

The time du-\\nration of limit orders, however, is unpredictable; limit orders can be “hit”\\nby market orders right away or can fail to be executed if the market price\\nmoves away from the price of the limit order. Failure to execute a limit\\norder can be quite costly when the limit order is placed to close a position,\\nparticularly when the position is a loss that needs to be liquidated. For ex-\\nample, consider a trading strategy that is currently long USD/CAD. Suppose\\nthat the position was opened with a market buy order at 1.2005, the current\\nmarket price is 1.1955, and a stop-loss order arrives to close the position. If\\nthe stop-loss order is placed as a market order, the order is executed with\\nprobability 1 at or below the current market price. If the order is placed\\nas a limit order, and if the market price for USD/CAD suddenly drops, the\\norder never gets ﬁlled and the losses exacerbate dramatically. As a result,\\nstop-losses are most often executed at market to ensure that the negative\\nexposure is reliably limited.\\nFailure to execute a limit order can also be costly when the order is\\nplaced to open a position, because the trading strategy incurs the oppor-\\ntunity cost corresponding to the average expected gain per trade. For ex-\\nample, consider a trading strategy that is “ﬂat,” or fully in cash, at time 0.\\nSuppose further that at time 1, a buy order arrives to buy USD/CAD while\\nUSD/CAD is at 1.2005. If the buy order is placed as a market order, the\\norder will be executed with a probability of 100 percent but at 1.2005 at\\nbest (latency in execution and other slippage issues may push the price\\neven further in the adverse direction). On the other hand, if the buy order\\nis placed as a limit order at 1.2000, the order may be executed at 1.2000 if\\nthe market price drops to that level, or it may not be executed at all if the\\nmarket price stays above the limit level. If the limit order never gets hit, the\\nsystem loses the trade opportunity value equal to the gain from the trade\\ninitiated at the market price.\\nFoucault (1999) and Parlour (1998) model dynamic conditions that en-\\nsure that limit orders get hit by market orders, while resulting in the prof-\\nitable outcome for the trader placing the limit orders. The main questions\\nanswered by the two research articles are\\n1. At what prices will traders post limit orders?\\n2. How often do traders modify their limit orders?\\nSuch issues in order ﬂow dynamics impact the traders’ bargaining\\npower and affect their proﬁtability through transaction costs. The main\\nﬁnding of the studies is that limit orders are preferred to market orders\\nin high-volatility conditions. Thus, in high-volatility situations, the propor-\\ntion of limit orders in the marketplace increases, simultaneously reducing\\ncumulative proﬁtability of agents resulting from a larger number of trades', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c3057fe8-7d20-4806-b7ad-d8a7381d4c2b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '81', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc06 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:20 Printer: Yet to come\\nOrders, Traders, and Their Applicability to High-Frequency Trading 67\\nthat are left not executed, as well as from the increased market bid-ask\\nspreads. Parlour (1998) further explains the diagonal effect observed in\\nBiais, Hillion and Spatt (1995): a market buy reduces the liquidity available\\nat the ask, inducing sellers to post additional limit sell orders instead of\\nmarket sell orders and subsequently triggering more market buy orders.\\nThus, serial autocorrelation in order ﬂow arises from liquidity dynamics in\\naddition to dynamics in informed trading. Ahn, Bae, and Chan (2001) ﬁnd\\nthat the volume of limit orders increases with increases in volatility on the\\nStock Exchange of Hong Kong.\\nBoth Foucault, Kadan, and Kandel (2005) and Rosu (2005) assume that\\ninvestors care about execution time and submit orders based on their ex-\\npectations of execution time.\\nKandel and Tkatch (2006) ﬁnd that investors indeed take execution\\ndelay into account when submitting limit orders on the Tel-Aviv Stock Ex-\\nchange. The duration of limit orders appears to decrease with increases in\\naggressiveness of the limit orders (the distance of the limit orders from the\\ncurrent market price), as shown by survival analysis of Lo, MacKinlay, and\\nZhang (2002).\\nGoettler, Parlour, and Rajan (2005) extend the analysis to a world\\nwhere investors can submit multiple limit orders, at different prices and\\nwith different order quantities. Lo and Sapp (2005) test the inﬂuence of or-\\nder size along with order aggressiveness in the foreign exchange markets\\nand ﬁnd that aggressiveness and size are negatively correlated.\\nHasbrouck and Saar (2002) document that limit order traders may post\\nﬂeeting limit orders; according to Rosu (2005), the ﬂeeting orders are offers\\nto split the difference made by patient investors on one side of the book to\\nthe patient investors on the other side of the book.\\nTraders who are conﬁdent in their information may choose to place\\nlimit orders during the time they expect their information to impact prices.\\nKeim and Madhavan (1995), for example, show that informed traders\\nwhose information decays slowly tend to use limit orders. The proportion\\nof limit orders used by a particular trader or trading strategy, therefore,\\ncan be used to measure the traders’ conﬁdence in their information. The\\nconﬁdence variable may then be used in extracting additional information\\nfrom the observed trading decisions and order ﬂow of the traders.\\nLimit Orders and Bid-Ask Spreads A trader may also gear towards\\nlimit orders whenever the bid-ask spreads are high. The bid-ask spread may\\nbe a greater cost than the opportunity cost associated with non-execution\\nof position entry orders placed as limit orders. Biais, Hillion, and Spatt\\n(1995) show that on the Paris Bourse the traders indeed place limit or-\\nders whenever the bid-ask spread is large and market orders whenever the\\nbid-ask spread is small.

The “good till can-\\nceled” orders (GTC) remain active in the order book until completely ﬁlled.\\nThe “good till date” orders (GTD) remain in the order book until completely\\nﬁlled or until the speciﬁed expiry date. The GTC and GTD orders can be\\n“killed,” or canceled, by the exchange or the ECN after a predeﬁned time\\nperiod (e.g., 90 days), whenever certain corporate actions are taken (e.g.,\\nbankruptcy or delisting), or as a result of structural changes on the ex-\\nchange (e.g., a change in minimum order sizes).\\nThe “day” orders, also known as the “good for the day” (GFD) orders,\\nremain in the order book until completely ﬁlled or until the end of the trad-\\ning day, deﬁned as the end of normal trading hours. The “good for the ex-\\ntended day” (GFE) orders allow the day orders to be executed until the end\\nof the extended trading session. Orders even shorter in duration that are\\nparticularly well suited for high-frequency trading are the “good till time”\\n(GTT) orders. The GTT orders remain in the order book until completely\\nﬁlled or until the speciﬁed expiry date and time and can be used to specify\\nshort-term orders. The GTT orders are especially useful in markets where\\norder cancellation or order change fees are common, such as in the options\\nmarkets. When market conditions change, instead of canceling or changing\\nthe order and thus incurring order cancellation or change fees, traders can\\nlet their previous orders expire at a predetermined time and place new or-\\nders instead.\\nOrder Size Speciﬁcations\\nThe straightforward or plain “vanilla,” order size speciﬁcation in both limit\\nand market orders is a simple number of security contracts geared for', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='edd996d5-774e-4761-b071-13debc455c3e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '83', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc06 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 19:20 Printer: Yet to come\\nOrders, Traders, and Their Applicability to High-Frequency Trading 69\\nexecution. Vanilla order sizes are typically placed in “round lots”—that is,\\nthe standard contract sizes traded on the exchange. For example, a round\\nlot for common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is 100\\nshares. Smaller orders, known as “odd lots,” are ﬁlled by a designated odd\\nlot dealer (on a per-security basis), and are normally charged higher trans-\\naction costs than the round-lot orders. Both market and limit orders can be\\nodd lots.\\nOrders bigger than round lots, yet not in round-lot multiples, are known\\nas “mixed lots.” Mixed-lot orders are typically broken down into the round\\nlots and the odd lots on the exchange and are executed accordingly by a\\nregular dealer and the odd-lot dealer.\\nWhen large market orders are placed, there may not be enough liq-\\nuidity to ﬁll the order, and subsequent liquidity may be attainable only\\nat prices unacceptable to the trader placing the market order. To address\\nthe problem, most exchanges and ECNs accept “ﬁll or kill” (FOK) orders\\nthat specify that the order be ﬁlled immediately in full, or in part, with the\\nunﬁlled quantity killed in its entirety. If the partial ﬁll of the market order\\nis unacceptable to the trader, the order can be speciﬁed as a “ﬁll and kill”\\n(FAK) order, to be either ﬁlled immediately in full or killed in its entirety.\\nAlternatively, if the immediacy of the order execution is not the principal\\nconcern but the size is, the order can be speciﬁed as an “all or none” (AON)\\norder. The AON orders remain in the order book with their original time\\npriorities until they can be ﬁlled in full.\\nOrder Disclosure Speciﬁcations\\nThe amount of order information that is disclosed varies from exchange\\nto exchange and from ECN to ECN. On some exchanges and ECNs, all\\nmarket and limit orders are executed with full transparency to all market\\nparticipants. Other exchanges, such as the NYSE, allow market makers to\\ndecide how much of an incoming market order should be executed at a\\ngiven price. Other exchanges show limit orders only for a restricted set of\\nprices that are near the current market price. Still others permit “iceberg”\\norders—that is, orders with only a portion of the order size observable to\\nother market participants.\\nA “standard iceberg” (SI) order is a limit order that speciﬁes a total\\nsize and a disclosed size. The disclosed size is revealed as a limit order.\\nOnce the disclosed size is completely executed, the new quantity becomes\\ndisclosed, and it is instantaneously made available for matching with time\\npriority corresponding to the release time.\\nAn order is often placed anonymously, without disclosing the identity\\nof the trader or the trading institution to other market participants on the\\ngiven exchange or ECN.

Both the stop-\\nloss and take-proﬁt orders become market or limit orders to buy or sell the\\nsecurity if a speciﬁed price, known as the stop price, is reached, or passed.\\nAdministrative Orders\\nA change order is an order to change a pending limit order, whether a limit\\nopen or limits for take-proﬁt or stop-loss. The change order can specify\\nthe change in the limit price, the order type (buy or sell), and the number\\nof units to process. A change order can also be placed to cancel an ex-\\nisting limit order. Some execution counterparties may charge a fee for a\\nchange order.\\nA margin call close order is one order traders probably want to avoid.\\nIt is initiated by the executing counterparty whenever a trader trades on\\nmargin and the amount of cash in the trader’s account is not sufﬁcient to\\ncover two times the losses of all open positions. The margin call close is\\nexecuted at market at the end of day, which varies depending on the ﬁnan-\\ncial instrument traded.\\nMost broker-dealers and ECNs provide phone support for clients. If\\ncustomer computer system or network connectivity breaks down for what-\\never reason, a customer can phone in an order. Such phone-in orders are\\nsometimes referred to as “orders by hand,” and are often charged a trans-\\naction cost premium relative to the electronic ordering.\\nFinally, several cancel orders can be initiated either by the customer\\nor by the executing counterparty. An insufﬁcient funds cancel can be en-\\nacted by the executing broker in the event that the customer does not have\\nenough funds to open a new position. Limit orders can be canceled if the\\nprice of the underlying instrument moves outside the preselected bounds;\\nsuch orders are known as bound violation cancel orders.\\nORDER DISTRIBUTIONS\\nOrder statistics, such as Oanda’s FX Trade presented in Table 6.3, are sel-\\ndom, if ever, distributed to the public.

The observed discrepancy probably reﬂects the\\nrelative propensity of higher-volume traders to seek bargains—that is to\\nplace limit open orders farther away from the market in the hope of enter-\\ning a position at a lower buy or a higher sell.\\nAmong the opened positions, long and short, discrepancies persisted\\nrelating to the position closing method. A comparison of columns 2 and 3 in\\nTable 6.4 shows that larger customers were less likely to close their posi-\\ntions using take-proﬁt and stop-loss orders than were smaller customers\\nand that larger customers preferred to close their positions using mar-\\nket orders instead. This ﬁnding may reﬂect the relative sophistication of\\nlarger customers: since all the take-proﬁt and stop-loss orders may be artiﬁ-\\ncially triggered by Oanda’s proprietary trading team, larger customers may\\nbe posting well-timed market orders instead. However, among those cus-\\ntomers using take-proﬁt and stop-loss provisions, smaller customers had a\\nhigher success ratio: by the number of orders, customers took proﬁt on 21\\npercent of orders and experienced stop-losses on 16 percent of orders.

Careful strategy design, extensive back testing, risk man-\\nagement, and implementation are needed to realize the high-frequency gain\\npotential.\\nThe proﬁtability of a trading strategy is often measured by Sharpe\\nratios, a risk-adjusted return metric ﬁrst proposed by Sharpe (1966). As\\nTable 7.2 shows, maximum Sharpe ratios increase with increases in trading\\nfrequencies. From March 11, 2009, through March 22, 2009, the maximum\\npossible annualized Sharpe ratio for EUR/USD trading strategies with daily\\nposition rebalancing was 37.3, while EUR/USD trading strategies that held\\npositions for 10 seconds could potentially score Sharpe ratios well over the\\n5,000 mark.\\nThe maximum possible intra-day Sharpe ratio is computed as a sam-\\nple period’s average range divided by the sample period’s standard devia-\\ntion of the range, adjusted by square root of the number of observations in\\na year:\\nSR = E[Range]\\nσ[Range] ×\\n√\\n(# Intra-day Periods) × (# Trading Days in a Year)\\n(7.1)\\nNote that high-frequency strategies normally do not carry overnight posi-\\ntions and, therefore, do not incur the overnight carry cost often proxied by\\nthe risk-free rate in Sharpe ratios of longer-term investments.\\nIn practice, well-designed and -implemented strategies trading at the\\nhighest frequencies tend to produce the highest proﬁtability with the\\ndouble-digit Sharpe ratios.

In\\nseeking such signals, both human traders and econometricians designing\\nsystematic trading platforms are looking to uncover sources of predictabil-\\nity of future price movements in selected securities. Predictability, both\\nin trading and statistics, is the opposite of randomness. It is, therefore,\\nthe objective of every trading system to ﬁnd ways to distinguish between\\npredictable and random price moves and then to act on the predictable\\nones.\\nWhile the future is never certain, history can offer us some clues about\\nhow the future may look given certain recurring events. All successful trad-\\ning systems, therefore, are ﬁrst tested on large amounts of past histori-\\ncal data. Technical analysts, for example, pore over historical price charts\\nto obtain insights into past price behaviors. Fundamental analysts often\\nrun multiple regressions to determine how one fundamental factor inﬂu-\\nences another. High-frequency trading system developers run their models\\nthrough years of tick data to ascertain the validity of their trading signals.\\nA more scientiﬁc method for analyzing a particular ﬁnancial security\\nmay lie in determining whether price changes of the security are random\\nor not.

An efﬁcient market (Fama, 1970) should\\ninstantaneously reﬂect all the available information in prices of the traded\\nsecurities. If the information is impounded into the securities slowly, then\\narbitrage opportunities exist, and the market is considered to be inefﬁcient.\\nFigure 7.1 illustrates the idea of efﬁcient versus inefﬁcient markets. To\\nidentify markets with arbitrage opportunities is to ﬁnd inefﬁcient markets.\\nThe arbitrage opportunities themselves are market inefﬁciencies.\\nIn Figure 7.1, panel (a) shows efﬁcient and inefﬁcient market re-\\nsponses to “good” information that pushes the price of the security higher,\\nwhile panel (b) shows efﬁcient and inefﬁcient market responses to “bad”\\ninformation that lowers the price of the security. The price of the secu-\\nrity in the efﬁcient market adjusts to the new level instantaneously at the\\ntime the news comes out. The price of the security in the inefﬁcient market\\nbegins adjusting before the news becomes public (“information leakage”),\\nand usually temporarily overreacts (“overshoots”) once the news becomes\\npublic. Many solid trading strategies exploit both the information leakage\\nand the overshooting to generate consistent proﬁts.\\nTesting for Market Efﬁciency and Predictability\\nThe more inefﬁcient the market, the more predictable trading opportuni-\\nties become available. Tests for market efﬁciency help discover the extent\\nof predictable trading opportunities. This chapter considers several tests\\nfor market efﬁciency designed to help the researchers to select the most\\nproﬁtable markets. The chapter by no means considers all the market ef-\\nﬁciency tests that have been proposed in the academic literature; rather,\\nit summarizes key tests with varying degrees of complexity, from the sim-\\nplest to the most advanced.\\nThe market efﬁciency hypothesis has several “levels”: weak, semi-\\nstrong, and strong forms of market efﬁciency.

Other forms of market efﬁciency restrict the kinds\\nof information that can be considered in forecasting prices. The strong\\nform deals with all kinds of public and nonpublic information; the semi-\\nstrong form excludes nonpublic information from the information set. As\\nin most contemporary academic literature on market efﬁciency, we restrict\\nthe tests to the weak form analysis only.\\nNon-Parametric Runs Test Several tests of market efﬁciency have\\nbeen developed over the years. The very ﬁrst test, constructed by Louis\\nBachelier in 1900, measured the probability of a number of consecutively\\npositive or consecutively negative price changes, or “runs.” As with tossing\\na fair coin, the probability of two successive price changes of the same sign\\n(a positive change followed by a positive change, for example) is 1/(22) =\\n0.25. The probability of three successive price changes of the same sign is\\n1/(23) = 0.125. Four successive price changes of the same sign are even\\nless likely, having the probability of 1/(24) = 0.0625 or 6.25 percent. Several\\nprice changes of the same sign in a row present a trading opportunity at\\nwhichever frequency one chooses to consider, the only requirement being\\nthe ability to overcome the transaction costs accompanying the trade.\\nT h et e s tw o r k sa sf o l l o w s :\\n1. Within a sample containing price moves of the desired frequency, note\\nthe number of sequences consisting strictly of price moves of the same\\nsign. If the desired frequency is every tick, then a run can be a sequence\\nof strictly positive or strictly negative price increments from one tick\\nto the next. If the desired frequency is one minute, a run can be a se-\\nquence of strictly positive or strictly negative price increments mea-\\nsured at 1-minute intervals. Table 7.3 shows 1-minute changes in the\\nAUD/USD exchange rate that occurred from 16:00 GMT to 16:20 GMT\\non June 8, 2009.\\nThe 1-minute changes are calculated as follows: if the closing\\nprice for AUD/USD recorded for a given minute is higher than that\\nfor the previous minute, the change for the given minute is recorded\\nto be positive. If the closing price for AUD/USD recorded for a given\\nminute is lower than that for the previous minute, the change for the\\ngiven minute is recorded to be negative. As shown in Table 7.3, from\\n16:00 GMT to 16:20 GMT, there were in total nine minutes with positive\\nchange in AUD/USD, eight minutes with negative change in AUD/USD,\\nand three minutes with 0 change in AUD/USD. Altogether, there were\\nsix positive runs whereby the price of AUD/USD increased, and four\\nnegative runs where the price of AUD/USD decreased.

Next, we test whether the realized number of runs indicates statistical\\nnonrandomness. The runs at the selected frequency are deemed pre-\\ndictable, or nonrandom, with 95 percent statistical conﬁdence if the\\nnumber of runs is at least 1.654 standard deviations s away from the\\nmean ¯x. The number of runs is not random if the two-tailed test based\\non Z-score is rejected. The Z-score is computed as Z = |u− ¯x|− 0.5\\ns .I n\\nother words, the randomness of runs is rejected with 95 percent statis-\\ntical conﬁdence wheneverZ is greater than 1.645. The randomness of\\nruns cannot be rejected if Z < 1.645.\\nIn the example of Table 7.3, Z = 0.0147; therefore, randomness of 1-\\nminute changes in the sample cannot be rejected.\\nTable 7.4 summarizes runs test Z-scores obtained for several securi-\\nties on data of different frequency for all data of June 8, 2009. As Table 7.4\\nshows, the runs test rejects randomness of price changes at 1-minute fre-\\nquencies, except for prices on S&P 500 Depository Receipts (SPY). The\\nresults imply strong market inefﬁciency in 1-minute data for the securities\\nshown. Market inefﬁciency measured by runs test decreases or disappears\\nentirely at a frequency lower than 10 minutes.\\nTests of Random Walks Other, more advanced tests for market\\nefﬁciency have been developed over the years.

From equation (7.2), log price changes /Delta1ln Pt\\nare obtained as follows:\\n/Delta1ln Pt = ln Pt − ln Pt−1 = εt\\nAt any given time, the change in log price is equally likely to be positive and\\nnegative. The logarithmic price speciﬁcation ensures that the model does\\nnot allow prices to become negative (logarithm of a negative number does\\nnot exist).\\nThe random walk process can drift, and be speciﬁed as shown in equa-\\ntion (7.3):\\nln Pt = µ + ln Pt−1 + εt (7.3)\\nIn this case, the average change in prices equals the drift rather than 0,\\nsince/Delta1ln Pt = ln Pt − ln Pt−1 = µ + εt. The drift can be due to a variety of\\nfactors; persistent inﬂation, for example, would uniformly lower the value\\nof the U.S. dollar, inﬂicting a small positive drift on prices of all U.S. equi-\\nties. At very high frequencies, however, drifts are seldom noticeable.\\nLo and MacKinlay (1988) developed a popular test for whether or not a\\ngiven price follows a random walk. The test can be applied to processes\\nwith or without drift. The test procedure is built around the following\\nprinciple: if price changes measured at a given frequency (e.g., one hour)\\nare random, then price changes measured at a lower frequency (e.g., two\\nhours) should also be random. Furthermore, the variances of the 1-hour\\nand 2-hour changes should be deterministically related. Note that the re-\\nverse does not apply; randomness in 1-hour price changes does not imply\\nrandomness in 10-minute price changes, nor does it imply a relationship in\\nvariances between the 1-hour and 10-minute samples.\\nThe test itself is based on the following estimators:\\nˆµ = 1\\n2n\\n2n∑\\nk=1\\n(ln Pk − ln Pk−1) = 1\\n2n(ln P2n − ln P0) (7.4)\\nˆσ2\\na = 1\\n2n\\n2n∑\\nk=1\\n(ln Pk − ln Pk−1 − ˆµ)2 (7.5)\\nˆσ2\\nb = 1\\n2n\\nn∑\\nk=1\\n(ln P2k − ln P2k−2 − 2ˆµ)2 (7.6)\\nIf the error term εt in equations (7.2) or (7.3) is a sequence of indepen-\\ndent, identically normally distributed numbers with mean 0 and variance', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='6f3fcaaf-ee6d-4b71-8c74-777b05dab570', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '98', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc07 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 14:12 Printer: Yet to come\\n84 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nσ2\\n0 ,ε t ∼ i.i.d.N(0,σ 2\\n0 ), then Lo and MacKinlay (1988) show that the differ-\\nences in parametersσ2\\n0 ,ˆσ2\\na (7.5), and ˆσ2\\nb (7.6) are asymptotically distributed\\nas follows:\\n√\\n2n(ˆσ2\\na − σ2\\n0 )\\na\\n∼ N(0,2σ4\\n0 ) (7.7)\\n√\\n2n(ˆσ2\\nb − σ2\\n0 )\\na\\n∼ N(0,4σ4\\n0 ) (7.8)\\nThe test for market efﬁciency is then performed as speciﬁed by equation\\n(7.9):\\nJr ≡ ˆσ2\\nb\\nˆσ2a\\n− 1,\\n√\\n2nJr\\na\\n∼ N(0,2) (7.9)\\nLo and MacKinlay (1988) subsequently use the test on daily, weekly,\\nand monthly equity data and conclude that while market efﬁciency cannot\\nbe rejected for weekly and monthly frequency, daily equity prices are not\\nefﬁcient.\\nTable 7.5 summarizes the results of the variance ratio test applied\\nto several foreign exchange instruments across different frequencies.

Sur-\\nprisingly, 1-hr put and call options have fewer trading opportunities than\\ndo spot and futures at the same frequency. Higher frequency markets, how-\\never, show more persistent proﬁt pockets, further strengthening the case\\nfor already popular high-frequency trading styles.\\nAs documented in Table 7.5, even in foreign exchange, value oppor-\\ntunities exist at high frequencies. Extracting that value requires much in-\\ngenuity, speed, and precision and can be a time-consuming and expensive\\nprocess. The tests for market efﬁciency save traders time and money by\\nenabling the selection of the most proﬁtable ﬁnancial instruments and fre-\\nquencies prior to committing to development of trading models.\\nAutoregression-Based Tests Trading strategies perform best in the\\nleast efﬁcient markets, where abundant arbitrage opportunities exist. Per-\\nfectly efﬁcient markets instantaneously incorporate all available market\\ninformation, allowing no dependencies from past price movements. One\\nway to measure the relative degree of market efﬁciency, therefore, is to\\nestimate the explanatory power of past prices. Mech (1993) and Hou and\\nMoskowitz (2005), for example, propose to measure market efﬁciency as\\nthe difference betweenAdjusted R2 coefﬁcients of an unrestricted model\\nattempting to explain returns with lagged variables and of a restricted\\nmodel involving no past data.\\nThe unrestricted model is speciﬁed as follows:\\nri,t = αi + βi,1ri,t−1 + βi,2ri,t−2 + βi,3ri,t−3 + βi,4ri,t−4 + εi,t (7.10)\\nwhere ri,t is the return on security i at time t (see Chapter 8 for a detailed\\ndiscussion on the computation of returns).\\nThe restricted model restricts all coefﬁcients βi,j to be 0:\\nri,t = αi + εi,t (7.11)\\nMarket inefﬁciency is next calculated as the relative difference be-\\ntween Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) R2 coefﬁcients of the two models:\\nMarket Inefﬁciency = 1 − R2\\nRestricted\\nR2\\nUnrestricted\\n(7.12)\\nThe closer the difference is to 0, the smaller the inﬂuence of past price\\nmovements and the higher the market efﬁciency.\\nMarket Efﬁciency Tests Based on the Martingale Hypothesis A\\nclassic deﬁnition of market efﬁciency in terms of security returns is due to', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='87867f80-4322-44b2-89b6-98fa780a1eff', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '101', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc07 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 14:12 Printer: Yet to come\\nMarket Ineﬃciency and Proﬁt Opportunities at Diﬀerent Frequencies 87\\nSamuelson (1965), who showed that properly anticipated prices ﬂuctuate\\nrandomly in an efﬁcient market. In other words, if all of the news is in-\\ncorporated instantaneously into the price of a given ﬁnancial security, the\\nexpected price of the security given current information is always the cur-\\nrent price of the security itself. This relationship is known as a martingale.\\nFormally, a stochastic price process {Pt} is a martingale within informa-\\ntion set It if the best forecast of Pt+1 based on current information It is\\nequal to Pt:\\nE[Pt+1|It] = Pt (7.13)\\nApplying the martingale hypothesis to changes in price levels, we can\\nexpress “abnormal,” or returns in excess of expected returns given current\\ninformation, as follows:\\nZt+1 = /Delta1Pt+1 − E[/Delta1Pt+1|It] (7.14)\\nA market in a particular ﬁnancial security or a portfolio of ﬁnancial\\nsecurities is then said to be efﬁcient when abnormal return Zt+1 i sa“ f a i r\\ngame”—that is,\\nE[Zt+1|It] = 0 (7.15)\\nLeRoy (1989) provides an extensive summary of the literature on the\\nsubject.\\nA ﬁnancial securities market characterized by fair game returns is ef-\\nﬁcient as it lacks consistent proﬁt opportunities. As Fama (1991) pointed\\nout, in a market with trading costs, equation (7.15) will hold within trading\\ncost deviations.\\nFama (1991) also suggested that the efﬁcient markets hypothesis is dif-\\nﬁcult to test for the following reason: the idea of a market fully reﬂect-\\ning all available information contains a joint hypothesis. On the one hand,\\nexpected values of returns are a function of information. On the other\\nhand, differences of realized returns from their expected values are ran-\\ndom. Incorporating both issues in the same test is difﬁcult. Nevertheless,\\nmartingale-based tests for market efﬁciencies exist.\\nFroot and Thaler (1990), for example, derive a speciﬁcation for a test\\nof market efﬁciency of a foreign exchange rate. In equilibrium, foreign ex-\\nchange markets follow the uncovered interest rate parity hypothesis that\\nformulates the price of a foreign exchange rate as a function of interest\\nrates in countries on either side of the interest rate.

The\\nspeculative efﬁciency hypothesis due to Hansen and Hodrick (1980) pro-\\nposes that the expected rate of return from speculation in the forward mar-\\nket conditioned on available information is zero. The arbitraging efﬁciency\\nhypothesis puts forward that the expected return on a portfolio composed\\nof long one unit of currency and short one future contract on that unit of\\ncurrency is zero. The arbitrage strategy of buying one unit of currency and\\nselling one futures contract is known as uncovered interest arbitrage.

A return is a differ-\\nence between two subsequent price quotes normalized by the earlier price\\nlevel. Independent of the price level, returns are convenient for direct per-\\nformance comparisons across various ﬁnancial instruments. A simple re-\\nturn measure can be computed as shown in equation (8.1):\\nRt = Pt − Pt−1\\nPt−1\\n= Pt\\nPt−1\\n− 1 (8.1)\\nwhere Rt is the return for periodt, Pt is the price of the ﬁnancial instrument\\nof interest in period t, and Pt − 1 is the price of the ﬁnancial instrument\\nin period t − 1. As discussed previously, determination of prices in high-\\nfrequency data may not always be straightforward; quotes arrive at random\\nintervals, but the analysis demands that the data be equally spaced.\\nDespite the intuitiveness of simple returns, much of the ﬁnancial liter-\\nature relies on log returns. Log returns are deﬁned as follows:\\nrt = ln (Rt) = ln (Pt) − ln (Pt−1) (8.2)\\nLog returns are often preferred to simple returns for the following\\nreasons:\\n1. If log returns are assumed to follow a normal distribution, then the\\nunderlying simple returns and the asset prices used to compute simple\\nreturns follow a lognormal distribution. Lognormal distributions better\\nreﬂect the actual distributions of asset prices than do normal distribu-\\ntions. For example, asset prices are generally positive. Lognormal dis-\\ntribution models this property perfectly, whereas normal distributions\\nallow values to be negative.\\n2. Like distributions of asset prices, lognormal distributions have fatter\\ntails than do normal distributions. Although lognormal distributions\\ntypically fail to model the fatness of the tails of asset prices exactly,\\nlognormal distributions better approximate observed fat tails than do\\nnormal distributions.\\n3. Once log prices have been computed, log returns are easy and fast to\\nmanipulate.\\nReturns can be computed on bid prices, ask prices, last trade prices,\\nor mid prices. Mid prices can be taken to be just an arithmetic average,\\nor a mid-point between a bid and an ask price at any point in time.

For example, autocorrelation of\\norder 1 measures of 1-minute returns is a correlation of 1-minute returns\\nwith 1-minute returns that occurred 1 minute earlier. Autocorrelation of\\norder 2 measures of 1-minute returns is a correlation of 1-minute returns\\nwith 1-minute returns that occurred 2 minutes earlier. The autocorrelation\\nvalue of order p can be determined as follows:\\nρ(p) =\\nT∑\\nt=p+1\\n[\\n(Rt − E[R])(Rt−p − E[R])\\n]\\n(\\nT∑\\nt=p+1\\n(Rt − E[R])\\n) 1/2 (\\nT∑\\nt=p+1\\n(Rt−p − E[R])\\n) 1/2 (8.10)\\nAs any other correlation function, ρ(p) ranges from −1 to 1. Equation\\n(8.10) uses simple returns to compute autocorrelation, but returns of any\\ntype can be used instead.\\nAutocorrelation is of interest because its results indicate a persistent\\nbehavior in returns. For example, Dacorogna et al. (2001) report negative\\nﬁrst-order autocorrelation in 10-minute spot foreign exchange data as evi-\\ndence of persistent trends in price formation.\\nAutocorrelation allows us to check whether there are any persistent\\nmomentum/reversal relationships in the data that we could trade upon. For\\nexample, it is a well-known stylized fact that a large swing, or momentum,\\nin the price of a ﬁnancial security is typically followed by a reversal. Using\\nautocorrelation at different frequencies we can actually establish whether\\nthe patterns persist and whether we can trade upon them.\\nAutocorrelation, like any correlation function, can range from −1t o1 .\\nHigh autocorrelation, say 0.5 and higher, implies a signiﬁcant positive re-\\nlationship between current and lagged observations. Low autocorrelation,\\nsay−0.5 and lower, in turn implies a signiﬁcant negative relationship be-\\ntween current and lagged observations. Thus, if a return today is positive\\nand the lag-1 autocorrelation is greater than 0.5, we can expect that the re-\\nturn tomorrow will be positive as well, at least 50 percent of the time. Thus,\\nif a return today is positive and the lag-1 autocorrelation is less than −0.5,\\nwe can expect that the return tomorrow will be negative at least 50 per-\\ncent of the time. Little, if anything, can be said about lagged relationships\\ncharacterized by correlations closer to 0.\\nOf course, we cannot make sweeping inferences without ﬁrst formally\\ntesting the statistical signiﬁcance of the observed autocorrelation. There\\nare two popular tests: (1) a t-ratio test allows us to check whether autocor-\\nrelation is signiﬁcant at a speciﬁc lag, and (2) the Portmanteau test and its\\nvariation, the Ljung-Box test, allow us to determine the last signiﬁcant au-\\ntocorrelation in the sequence, beginning with ρ(1).

Unlike the\\nt-ratio test, which tests the statistical signiﬁcance of an individual autocor-\\nrelation at a particular lag, both the Portmanteau and Ljung-Box tests help\\nus determine whether correlations at lags 1, 2, ... , l are jointly signiﬁcant.\\nThe end-goal of the test is to ﬁnd the lag m where autocorrelations\\n1, 2, ... , m are jointly signiﬁcant, but autocorrelations 1, 2, ... , m, m + 1\\nare no longer jointly signiﬁcant. Such a lag m, once identiﬁed, signals the\\noptimal number of lags to be used in further modeling for the security un-\\nder consideration.\\nBoth Portmanteau and Ljung-Box tests produce similar results when\\nthe number of observations is large. The Ljung-Box test is optimized for\\nsamples with at least 200 observations or 30 at the very minimum.\\nFormally, the tests are speciﬁed as follows: the null hypothesis is\\nthat the m autocorrelations are not jointly statistically signiﬁcant—that is,\\nH0 : ρ1 = ...ρ m = 0, and the alternative hypothesis is Ha : ρi ̸=0 for some\\ni ∈{ 1,..., m}.

While autoregressive AR\\nmodels estimate what proportion of past period data is likely to persist\\nin future periods, MA models focus on how future data reacts to innova-\\ntion in the past data. In other words, AR models estimate future responses\\nto the expected component realized in the past persistence, whereas MA\\nmodels measure future responses to the unexpected component realized\\nin the past data. Figure 8.1 illustrates the difference between AR and MA\\nestimation.\\nUnlike the AR models that can be estimated using ordinary least-\\nsquares or OLS regressions, estimation of moving average models is more\\ncomplex.

Run autocorrelation analysis to determine the last statistically signiﬁ-\\ncant lag, q.\\n2. Estimate c0 by running the following OLS regression ofrt on a vector of\\n1’s:rt = c0 + at, assuming at ∼ N(0,σ 2). Determine a1’s asat = rt − c0.\\n3.

Cointegration measures the con-\\ntemporaneous or lagged effect of one variable on another variable. For\\nexample, if both time series {x} and {y} represent price time series of two\\nﬁnancial securities, cointegration identiﬁes a lead-lag relationship between\\nthe two time series.\\nThe simplest test for lead-lag relationships can be speciﬁed using the\\nfollowing equation, ﬁrst suggested by Engle and Granger (1987):\\nxt = α + βyt + εt (8.20)\\nEquation (8.20) can be estimated using OLS, with the residuals tested for\\nstationarity.\\nThe cointegration speciﬁcation of equation (8.20), however, does not\\nreveal whether one variable drives or causes another.

Cointegration can also be an important\\ncomponent of portfolio management and hedging applications.\\nVOLATILITY MODELING\\nMost of today’s uses of volatility modeling involve forecasting components\\nof future returns. The forecasts range from the point forecasts to quantiles\\nof returns to the probabilistic density of future returns. These forecasts\\nare used by portfolio managers to optimize the performance of their in-\\nvestment vehicles, by risk managers to limit their trading downside, and\\nby quantitative traders to develop superior trading models. According to\\nEngle and Patton (2001, p. 238):\\nA risk manager must know today the likelihood that his portfolio\\nwill decline in the future. An option trader will want to know the\\nvolatility that can be expected over the future life of the contract. To\\nhedge this contract he will also want to know the volatility of his\\nforecast. A portfolio manager may want to sell a stock or a portfolio\\nbefore it becomes too volatile. A market maker may want to set the\\nbid ask spread wider when the future is believed to be more volatile.\\nA good volatility model is the one that competently forecasts\\nvolatility:\\n1. Volatility is persistent.\\n2. Volatility is mean-reverting.\\n3. Market returns may have asymmetric impact on volatility.\\n4. External (exogenous) variables may affect volatility.\\nPersistence of volatility is sometimes referred to as “volatility cluster-\\ning.” The phenomenon describes the observed persistence in the levels of', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='49e461ea-139f-4c7f-b33b-6540cb54cb1c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '117', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc08 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 20:9 Printer: Yet to come\\nSearching for High-Frequency Trading Opportunities 103\\nvolatility; if volatility is high today, it is likely to be high tomorrow. The\\nconverse is also true; volatility that is low during the current observation\\nperiod is likely to remain low in the next observation period. The observed\\nvolatility persistence implies that “shocks” (unusually large price moves)\\nwill impact expected volatility measures many observation periods ahead.\\nAccording to Engle and Patton (2001), the impact of shocks on future\\nvolatility expectations declines geometrically but can be seen in options\\ndata as long as one year after the occurrence of the shock.\\nThe mean-reversion properties of volatility describe the phenomenon\\nwhereby volatility regresses to its optimal intrinsic levels. Thus, if volatility\\nis unusually high one period and, due to persistence, will remain high for\\nseveral observation periods, it will nevertheless eventually fall to its nor-\\nmal level. A useful tool for comparing volatility models is to compare the\\nmodels’ forecasts many periods ahead. According to the mean-reversion\\nproperty of volatility, long-term forecasts of all volatility models should\\nconverge on the same intrinsic volatility value, a ﬁnite number.\\nPositive and negative shocks to market returns have been found to\\nimpact subsequent volatility differently. Market crashes and other nega-\\ntive shocks have been shown to result in higher subsequent volatility lev-\\nels than rallies and other news favorable to the market. This asymmetric\\nproperty of volatility generates skews in volatility surfaces constructed\\nof option-implied volatilities for different option strike prices. Engle and\\nPatton (2001) cite the following example of volatility skews: the implied\\nvolatilities of in-the-money put options are lower than those of at-the-\\nmoney put options. Furthermore, the implied volatilities of at-the-money\\nput options are lower than the implied volatilities of out-of-the-money\\noptions.\\nFinally, volatility forecasts may be inﬂuenced by external events, such\\nas news announcements. In foreign exchange, for example, price and\\nreturn volatility of a particular currency pair increase markedly during\\nmacroeconomic announcements pertaining to one or both sides of the cur-\\nrency pair.\\nVolatility can be forecasted in a number of ways. The simplest volatility\\nforecast assumes that the volatility remains constant through time and that,\\nas a result, future volatility will be equal to the volatility estimate obtained\\nfrom historical data. In this case, the forecast for future squared volatility,\\nσ2\\nt+1, is just the variance of the past returns of the security or portfolio\\nunder consideration:\\nEt\\n[\\nσ2\\nt+1\\n]\\n= σ2\\nt = σ2 = 1\\nt − 1\\nt∑\\nτ=1\\n(\\nRτ − R\\n)2\\n(8.22)\\nOf course, volatility may change with time.

Accord-\\ning to the central limit theorem, the return window used for estimation of\\neach individual volatility forecast should contain at least 30 observations.\\nThe time spaces between subsequent returns used within the window can\\nbe made as short as required—thirty 1-second returns can be used to esti-\\nmate intraminute volatility.\\nThe moving window approach to volatility estimation places equal\\nweight on all the observations in the sample. The earliest changes in re-\\nturns are given the same weights as the latest changes, but the latest\\nchanges may possess more relevance to the present time and forecasting of\\nfuture returns. To address this issue, several weighting schemes for returns\\nwithin a volatility estimation window have been proposed.\\nThe simplest observation weighting scheme is linear or triangular\\nweighting: each of the T observations within the window is multiplied by\\na coefﬁcient that reﬂects the order of the observation within the window.\\nThe earliest observation is given the lowest weight, and the latest observa-\\ntions are given the highest signiﬁcance.

Current high volatility\\ndoes not typically revert to lower volatility levels instantaneously; instead,\\nhigh volatility persists for several time periods. The same observation holds\\nfor low volatility; low volatility at present is likely to lead to low volatility\\nin the immediate future.\\nTo model the observed volatility clustering, researchers use ARMA\\ntechnique on volatilities:\\nσ2\\nt = α0 +\\nm∑\\ni=1\\nαia2\\nt−i +\\ns∑\\nj=1\\nβjσ2\\nt−j (8.29)\\nwhere at = σtzt, where {zt} is a sequence of independent, identically dis-\\ntributed random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.

Various extensions to the GARCH speciﬁcation\\ninclude additional explanatory right-hand side variables controlling for\\nexternal events, an exponential “EGARCH” speciﬁcation that addresses\\nthe asymmetric response of returns to positive and negative shocks (bad\\nnews is typically accompanied by a higher volatility than good news), and\\na “GARCH-M” model in which the return of a security depends on the\\nsecurity’s volatility, among numerous other GARCH extensions.\\nIn addition to the moving window and GARCH volatility estimators,\\npopular volatility measurements include the intraperiod volatility estima-\\ntor, known as the “realized volatility;” several measures based on the in-\\ntraperiod range of prices; and a stochastic volatility model where volatility\\nis thought to be a random variable drawn from a prespeciﬁed distribu-\\ntion.

Estimation of GARCH can seem trivial in comparison with\\nthe estimation of stochastic volatility.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='da4fc9ab-5a41-4e2a-80b6-7ffc1d4260c7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '122', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc08 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 20:9 Printer: Yet to come\\n108 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nNONLINEAR MODELS\\nOverview\\nAs their name implies, nonlinear models allow modeling of complex non-\\ntrivial relationships in the data.\\nUnlike linear models discussed in the ﬁrst section of this chapter, non-\\nlinear models forecast random variables that cannot be expressed as linear\\ncombinations of other, contemporaneous or lagged, random variables with\\nwell-deﬁned distributions. Instead, nonlinear models can be expressed as\\nsome functions f(.) of other random variables. In mathematical terms, if a\\nlinear model can be expressed as shown in equation (8.37), reprinted here\\nfor convenience, then nonlinear models are best expressed as shown in\\nequation (8.38) which follows:\\nyt = α +\\n∞∑\\ni=0\\nβixt−i + εt (8.37)\\nyt = f (xt, xt−1, xt−2,··· ) (8.38)\\nwhere {yt} is the time series of random variables that are to be forecasted,\\n{xt} is a factor signiﬁcant in forecasting {yt}, and α and β are coefﬁcients\\nto be estimated.\\nThe one-step-ahead nonlinear forecast conditional on the information\\navailable in the previous period is usually speciﬁed using a Brownian mo-\\ntion formulation, as shown in equation (8.39):\\nyt+1 = µt+1 + σt+1ξt+1 (8.39)\\nwhere µt+1 = Et[yt+1] is the one-period-ahead forecast of the mean of the\\nvariable being forecasted, σt+1 =\\n√\\nvart[xt+1] is the one-period-ahead fore-\\ncast of the volatility of the variable being forecasted, and ξt+1 is an iden-\\ntically and independently distributed random variable with mean 0 and\\nvariance 1. The term ξt+1 is often referred to as a standardized shock or\\ninnovation.\\nThe nonlinear estimation is often used in pricing derivatives and other\\ncomplex ﬁnancial instruments. In fact, many readers will recognize equa-\\ntion (8.39) as the cornerstone equation of derivatives pricing models.\\nHere, we will brieﬂy review the following nonlinear estimation\\nmethods:\\nr Taylor series expansion (bilinear models)\\nr Threshold autoregressive model', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='312c4b9d-3f2f-4d55-9d09-276ba4f03ded', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '123', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc08 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 20:9 Printer: Yet to come\\nSearching for High-Frequency Trading Opportunities 109\\nr Markov switching model\\nr Nonparametric estimation\\nr Neural networks\\nFor a detailed examination of nonlinear estimation, please see\\nPriestley (1988) and Tong (1990).\\nTaylor Series Expansion (Bilinear Models)\\nOne of the simplest ways to deal with nonlinear functions is to linearize\\nthem using the Taylor series expansion.

For example, the model may have different speciﬁcations for pos-\\nitive and negative values of the dependent variable, in addition to separate\\nlinear models for large positive and large negative values. Such speciﬁca-\\ntion can be used in estimation of statistical arbitrage models.

As discussed in Chapter 7, the higher the data frequency, the\\nmore arbitrage opportunities appear. When researching proﬁtable op-\\nportunities, therefore, it is important to use data that is as granular as pos-\\nsible. Recent microstructure research and advances in econometric model-\\ning have facilitated a common understanding of the unique characteristics\\nof tick data. In contrast to traditional low-frequency regularly spaced data,\\ntick data is irregularly spaced with quotes arriving randomly at very short\\ntime intervals. The observed irregularities present researchers and traders\\nwith a wealth of information not available in low-frequency data sets. Inter-\\ntrade durations may signal changes in market volatility, liquidity, and other\\nvariables, as discussed further along in this chapter.\\nIn addition, the sheer volume of data allows researchers to produce\\nstatistically precise inferences. As noted by Dacorogna et al. (2001), large\\nsets of data can support considerably wider ranges of input variables\\n(parameters) because of the expanded number of allowable degrees of\\nfreedom.\\nFinally, the copious quantities of tick data allow researchers to use\\nshort-term data samples to make statistically signiﬁcant inferences pertain-\\ning to the latest changes in the markets. Whereas a monthly set of daily data\\nis normally deemed too short a sample to make statistically viable predic-\\ntions, volumes of tick data in the same monthly sample can make such\\nshort-term estimation practical.

Tick data usually\\nhas the following properties:\\nr A timestamp\\nr A ﬁnancial security identiﬁcation code\\nr An indicator of what information it carries:\\nr Bid price\\nr Ask price\\nr Available bid volume\\nr Available ask volume\\nr Last trade price\\nr Last trade size\\nr Option-speciﬁc data, such as implied volatility\\nr The market value information, such as the actual numerical value of\\nthe price, available volume, or size\\nA timestamp records the date and time at which the quote originated.\\nIt may be the time at which the exchange or the broker-dealer released\\nthe quote, or the time when the trading system has received the quote.\\nThe quote travel time from the exchange or the broker-dealer to the trad-\\ning system can be as small as 20 milliseconds. All sophisticated systems,\\ntherefore, include milliseconds as part of their timestamps.\\nPart of the quote is an identiﬁer of the ﬁnancial security. In equities, the\\nidentiﬁcation code can be a ticker, or, for tickers simultaneously traded on\\nmultiple exchanges, a ticker followed by the exchange symbol. For futures,\\nthe identiﬁcation code can consist of the underlying security, futures expi-\\nration date, and exchange code.\\nThe last trade price shows the price at which the last trade in the se-\\ncurity cleared.

The ask quote is the lowest price entered for buying the security at\\nany particular time. Both bid and ask quotes are provided by other market\\nparticipants through limit orders. A yet-to-be-executed limit order to buy\\nwith the highest price becomes the market bid, and a limit order to sell\\nwith the lowest price among other limit orders in the same book becomes\\nthe market ask. Available bid and ask volumes indicate the total demand\\nand supply, respectively, at the bid and ask prices.\\nQUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TICK DATA\\nHigh-frequency data is voluminous. According to Dacorogna et al. (2001),\\nthe number of observations in a single day of tick-by-tick data is equiva-\\nlent to 30 years of daily observations. The quality of data does not always\\nmatch its quantity. Centralized exchanges generally provide accurate data\\non bids, asks, and volume of any trade with a reasonably timely timestamp.\\nThe information on the limit order book is less commonly available. In de-\\ncentralized markets, such as foreign exchange and the interbank money\\nmarket, no market-wide quotes are available at any given time. In such\\nmarkets, participants are aware of the current price levels, but each insti-\\ntution quotes its own prices adjusted for its order book. In decentralized\\nmarkets, each dealer provides his own tick data to his clients. As a result,\\na speciﬁc quote on a given ﬁnancial instrument at any given time may vary\\nfrom dealer to dealer. Reuters, Telerate, and Knight Ridder, among others,\\ncollect quotes from different dealers and disseminate them back, improv-\\ning the efﬁciency of the decentralized markets. There are generally thought\\nto be three anomalies in inter-dealer quote discrepancies.\\nEach dealer’s quotes reﬂect that dealer’s own inventory. For example,\\na dealer that has just sold a customer $100 million of USD/CAD would\\nbe eager to diversify the risk of his position and avoid selling any more\\nof USD/CAD. Most dealers are, however, obligated to transact with their\\nclients on tradeable quotes. To incite his clients to place sell orders on\\nUSD/CAD, the dealer temporarily raises the bid quote on USD/CAD. At the\\nsame time, to encourage his clients to withhold placing buy orders, the\\ndealer raises the ask quote on USD/CAD. Thus, dealers tend to raise both\\nbid and ask prices whenever they are short in a particular ﬁnancial instru-\\nment and lower both bid and ask prices whenever they are disproportion-\\nally long in a ﬁnancial instrument.\\nIn an anonymous marketplace, such as a dark pool, dealers as well\\nas other market makers may “ﬁsh” for market information by sending in-\\ndicative quotes that are much off the previously quoted price to assess the\\navailable demand or supply.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3750e4e1-b8c8-46a8-ac8a-bd12844dade3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '132', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc09 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 21:57 Printer: Yet to come\\n118 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nDacorogna et al. (2001) note that some dealers’ quotes may lag real\\nmarket prices. The lag is thought to vary from milliseconds to a minute.\\nSome dealers quote moving averages of quotes of other dealers. The deal-\\ners who provide delayed quotes usually do so to advertise their market\\npresence in the data feed. This was particularly true when most order\\nprices were negotiated over the telephone, allowing a considerable de-\\nlay between quotes and orders. Fast-paced electronic markets discourage\\nlagged quotes, improving the quality of markets.\\nBID-ASK SPREADS\\nThe difference between the bid quote and the ask quote at any given time\\nis known as the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread is the cost of instan-\\ntaneously buying and selling the security. The higher the bid-ask spread,\\nthe higher a gain the security must produce in order to cover the spread\\nalong with other transaction costs. Most low-frequency price changes are\\nlarge enough to make the bid-ask spread negligible in comparison. In tick\\ndata, on the other hand, incremental price changes can be comparable or\\nsmaller than the bid-ask spread.\\nBid-ask spreads usually vary throughout the day. Figure 9.1 illustrates\\nthe average bid-ask spread cycles observed in the institutional EUR/USD\\nmarket for the last two weeks of October 2008. As Figure 9.1 shows, the\\naverage spread increases signiﬁcantly during Tokyo trading hours when\\nthe market is quiet. The spread then reaches its lowest levels during the\\noverlap of the London and New York trading sessions when the market has\\nmany active buyers and sellers.

Figure 9.2, for example, compares average bid-ask\\nspreads on EUR/USD in the stable market conditions of July–August 2008\\nand the crisis conditions of September–October 2008. As Figure 9.2 shows,\\nthe intra-day spread pattern is persistent in both crisis and normal market\\nconditions, but the spreads are signiﬁcantly higher during crisis months\\nthan during normal conditions at all hours of the day. As Figure 9.2 also\\nshows, the spread increase is not uniform at all hours of the day. The av-\\nerage hourly EUR/USD spreads increased by 0.0048% (0.48 basis points or\\npips) between the hours of 12 GMT and 16 GMT, when the London and\\nNew York trading sessions overlap.

The situation can\\nbe even more severe for high-frequency strategies built for less liquid in-\\nstruments. For example, bid-ask spreads for NZD/USD (not shown) on\\naverage increased thrice during September–October in comparison with\\nmarket conditions of July–August 2008.\\nFuture realizations of the bid-ask spread can be estimated using the\\nmodel of Roll (1984), where the price of an asset at time t, pt, is assumed\\nto equal an unobservable fundamental value, mt, offset by a value equal\\nto half of the bid-ask spread, s. The price offset is positive when the next\\nmarket order is a buy, and negative when the trade is a sell, as shown in\\nequation (9.1):\\npt = mt + s\\n2 It (9.1)\\nwhere\\nIt =\\n{ 1, market buy at ask\\n−1, market sell at bid\\nIf either a buy or a sell order can arrive next with equal probability,\\nthen E[It] = 0, and E[/Delta1pt] = 0, absent changes in the fundamental asset\\nvalue, mt. The covariance of subsequent price changes, however, is differ-\\nent from 0:\\ncov [/Delta1pt,/Delta1pt+1] = E [/Delta1pt/Delta1pt+1] =− s2\\n4 (9.2)\\nAs a result, the future expected spread can be estimated as follows:\\nE [s] = 2\\n√\\n−cov [/Delta1pt,/Delta1pt+1] whenever cov [/Delta1pt,/Delta1pt+1] < 0.\\nNumerous extensions of Roll’s model have been developed to account\\nfor contemporary market conditions along with numerous other variables.\\nHasbrouck (2007) provides a good summary of the models.\\nBID-ASK BOUNCE\\nWhile tick data carries information about market dynamics, it is also dis-\\ntorted by the same processes that make the data so valuable in the ﬁrst\\nplace.

Several researchers have stud-\\nied whether the time distance between subsequent quote arrivals itself car-\\nries information. Most researchers agree that inter-trade intervals indeed\\ncarry information on securities for which short sales are disallowed; the\\nlower the inter-trade duration, the more likely the yet-to-be-observed good\\nnews and the higher the impending price change.\\nThe process of information arrivals is modeled using so-called duration\\nmodels. Duration models are used to estimate the factors affecting the du-\\nration between any two sequential ticks. Such models are known as quote\\nprocesses and trade processes, respectively. Duration models are also used\\nto measure the time elapsed between price changes of a prespeciﬁed size,\\nas well as the time interval between predetermined trade volume incre-\\nments. The models working with ﬁxed price are known as price processes;\\nthe models estimating variation in duration of ﬁxed volume increments are\\nknown as volume processes.\\nDurations are often modeled using Poisson processes. Poisson pro-\\ncesses assume that sequential events, like quote arrivals, occur indepen-\\ndently of one another. The number of arrivals between any two time points\\ntand (t + τ) is assumed to have a Poisson distribution.\\nIn a Poisson process, λ arrivals occur per unit time. In other words, the\\narrivals occur at an average rate of (1/ λ). The average arrival rate may be\\nassumed to hold constant, or it may vary with time. If the average arrival\\nrate is constant, the probability of observing exactly k arrivals between\\ntimes t and (t + τ)i s\\nP[(N(t + τ) − N(t)) = k] = 1\\nk!e−λτ (λτ)k,k = 0,1,2,... (9.3)\\nDiamond and Verrecchia (1987) and Easley and O’Hara (1992) were\\nthe ﬁrst to suggest that the duration between subsequent data arrivals car-\\nries information. The models posit that in the presence of short-sale con-\\nstraints, inter-trade duration can indicate the presence of good news; in\\nmarkets of securities where short selling is disallowed, the shorter the\\ninter-trade duration, the higher is the likelihood of unobserved good news.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7584df1c-32a8-4cf6-978c-2760865becd6', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '136', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc09 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 21:57 Printer: Yet to come\\n122 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nThe reverse also holds: in markets with limited short selling and normal\\nliquidity levels, the longer the duration between subsequent trade arrivals,\\nthe higher the probability of yet-unobserved bad news. A complete absence\\nof trades, however, indicates a lack of news.\\nEasley and O’Hara (1992) further point out that trades that are sepa-\\nrated by a time interval have a much different information content than\\ntrades occurring in close proximity. One of the implications of Easley and\\nO’Hara (1992) is that the entire price sequence conveys information and\\nshould be used in its entirety whenever possible, strengthening the argu-\\nment for high-frequency trading.\\nTable 9.1 shows summary statistics for a duration measure computed\\non all trades recorded for S&P 500 Depository Receipts ETF (SPY) on\\nMay 13, 2009.

The compensation usually comes\\nin the form of a bid-ask spread and is a function of the waiting time until\\nthe order limit is “hit” by liquidity takers; lower inter-trade durations induce\\nlower spreads. However, Dufour and Engle (2000) and Saar and Hasbrouck\\n(2002) ﬁnd that spreads are actually higher when traders observe short du-\\nrations, contrasting the time-based limit order compensation hypothesis.\\nIn addition to durations between subsequent trades and quotes, re-\\nsearchers have also been modeling durations between ﬁxed changes in\\nsecurity prices and volumes. The time interval between subsequent price\\nchanges of a speciﬁed magnitude is known as price duration. Price du-\\nration has been shown to decrease with increases in volatility. Similarly,\\nthe time interval between subsequent volume changes of a prespeciﬁed\\nsize is known as the volume duration. Volume duration has been shown to\\ndecrease with increases in liquidity.\\nThe information content of quote, trade, price, and volume durations\\nintroduces biases into the estimation process, however. If the available\\ninformation determines the time between subsequent trades, time itself\\nceases to be an independent variable, introducing substantial endogeneity\\nbias into estimation. As a result, traditional estimates of variance of trans-\\naction prices are too high in comparison with the true variance of the price\\nseries. The variance of the high-frequency data, however, can be consis-\\ntently estimated using the generalized autoregressive conditional hetero-\\nscedasticity (GARCH) process framework that can incorporate inter-trade\\nand inter-quote duration.\\nAPPLYING TRADITIONAL ECONOMETRIC\\nTECHNIQUES TO TICK DATA\\nMost modern computational techniques have been developed to work with\\nregularly spaced data, presented in monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or other\\nconsistent intervals.

(2001) propose a potentially more precise way to sam-\\nple quotes—linear time-weighted interpolation between adjacent quotes.\\nAt the core of the interpolation technique is an assumption that at any given\\ntime, unobserved quotes lie on a straight line that connects two neighbor-\\ning observed quotes. Figure 9.3, panel (b) illustrates linear interpolation\\nsampling.\\nAs shown in Figure 9.3 panels (a) and (b), the two quote-sampling\\nmethods produce quite different results. Dacorogna et al.

In an institutional setting (e.g., on a propri-\\netary trading desk of a broker-dealer), a trader will often face transaction\\ncosts of 1 bp or less on selected securities, making a seconds-based trading\\nstrategy with an expected gain of at least 2 bps per trade quite proﬁtable.\\nOther institutional players, such as hedge funds, can expect their transac-\\ntion costs to range anywhere from 3 bps to 30 bps per trade, mandating\\nstrategies that call for longer holding periods.\\nAccording to Lyons (2001), the ﬁeld of market microstructure encom-\\npasses two general types of models—inventory models and information\\nmodels. Information models are concerned with the process of impound-\\ning information into prices in response to news. With information models,\\norder ﬂow carries information that induces price changes. Inventory\\nmodels, on the other hand, explain transitory variations in prices in the\\nabsence of news. As with information models, it is order ﬂow that causes\\nthese temporary variations. Unlike information models where order ﬂow\\nis a result of end customers receiving and acting on information, inventory\\nmodels concern themselves with the order ﬂow resulting from dealer book\\nimbalances.\\nThis chapter reviews inventory models and their applications to high-\\nfrequency trading. The following chapter, Chapter 11, discusses informa-\\ntion models.\\nOVERVIEW OF INVENTORY\\nTRADING STRATEGIES\\nInventory trading, also known as liquidity provision or market making,\\nconcerns itself with proﬁtable management of inventory. Liquidity pro-\\nvision was once performed only by dedicated broker-dealers, known as\\nmarket makers. Market makers kept enough liquidity on hand to satisfy\\nsupply and demand of any arriving traders. During the past decade, this\\nsystem changed. The proliferation of electronic transacting capability cou-\\npled with the 1997 SEC order display rule enabled most traders to place\\nthe short-term limit orders required to make markets. Several competitive\\nliquidity provision strategies have emerged to proﬁtably capture liquidity\\npremiums available in the markets.\\nInventory trading strategies possess the following key characteristics:\\nr The strategies are executed predominantly using limit orders, although\\nan occasional market order is warranted to close a position.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3ae80af4-3ffd-49bd-90d2-51204b69a7e0', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '144', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc10 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:53 Printer: Yet to come\\n130 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nr The strategies rely on a multitude of very small realized gains; it is not\\nuncommon for these strategies to move in and out of positions 2,000\\ntimes per day.\\nr As a result, these strategies operate at very high frequencies; short po-\\nsition holding time is what makes it possible to move capital in and out\\nof multiple trades, generating a large surplus at the end of each day.\\nr High-speed transmission of orders and low-latency execution are re-\\nquired for successful implementation of liquidity provision strategies.\\nORDERS, TRADERS, AND LIQUIDITY\\nOrders Used in Microstructure Trading\\nLimit orders, ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 6, are commitments to buy or sell\\na particular security at a prespeciﬁed price. Limit orders can be seen as\\nex-ante commitments to provide market liquidity. As noted by Demsetz\\n(1968), while limit orders are in queue, the trader who placed limit orders\\nincurs inventory and waiting costs. The inventory costs arise from the un-\\ncertainty as to the market price of the securities that the trader may hold\\nin his portfolio while his limit orders are pending. The waiting costs are\\nthe opportunity costs associated with the time between placing an order\\nand its execution. In addition, per Copeland and Galai (1983), limit orders\\nsuffer from an informational disadvantage, whereby they are picked off by\\nbetter-informed investors.\\nNaturally, the probability of limit orders being executed depends on\\nthe limit order price proximity to the current market price. Cohen, Maier,\\nSchwartz, and Whitcomb (1981), call this phenomenon a “gravitational\\npull” of existing quotes. Limit orders placed at current market quotes are\\nlikely to be executed, whereas the probability of execution for aggressive\\nlimit orders is close to zero.\\nTrading with limit orders generates nonlinear payoffs; sometimes limit\\norders execute and sometimes they do not. As a result, limit orders are difﬁ-\\ncult to model. As Parlour and Seppi (2008) point out, limit orders compete\\nwith other limit orders, both existing and those submitted in the future.\\nFurther, all limit orders execute against future market orders. Thus, when\\nselecting the price and quantity for a limit order, the trader must take into\\naccount the future trading process, including the current limit order book,\\nas well as past histories of orders and trading outcomes.\\nEarly limit order models, known as static equilibrium models, pre-\\nsumed that limit order traders were to be compensated for providing liq-\\nuidity. Examples of such models include Rock (1996), Glosten (1994),\\nand Seppi (1997).

Changing the details of a limit order was prohibitively\\ncostly, and market makers indeed expected a tidy compensation for bear-\\ning the risk of ending up in an adverse position once their limit orders\\nwere hit.\\nStatic equilibrium models, however, have found little empirical sup-\\nport in the recent literature. In fact, Sandas (2001) in his study of limit or-\\nders on actively traded stocks on the Stockholm Stock Exchange ﬁnds that\\nthe expected proﬁt on limit orders appears to decrease as the time dura-\\ntion between market orders increases, contradicting previously formulated\\ntheory. The implicit outcome of empirical evidence is that the limit orders\\nare submitted by traders with active proﬁt motives, rather than by market\\nmakers interested strictly in providing liquidity.\\nDemand for trading immediacy can be fueled by the traders’ need for\\ncapital and their risk aversion, among other factors. Traders strapped for\\ncash may choose to set the limit price close to the market to turn their\\npositions into cash as soon as possible. Risk-averse traders may choose\\nto set the limit price close to the market to ensure swift execution and to\\nminimize uncertainty.\\nAn extension to static equilibrium models penalizes aggressive limit\\norders with a non-execution cost. The cost can be considered a penalty\\nfor deviating too far from the trading targets of active limit order traders.\\nExamples of such an approach include Kumar and Seppi (1994), who mod-\\neled two types of limit order traders—value traders and liquidity traders.\\nValue traders submit limit orders to exploit undervalued limit orders but\\nhave no other reason to trade. Liquidity traders submit limit orders to re-\\nspond to random liquidity shocks; randomness in their orders leads to price\\nrisk for other traders’ market orders and execution risk in all limit orders.\\nCao, Hansch, and Wang (2004) ﬁnd cointegration of different orders in the\\nlimit order book, supporting the existence of value traders.\\nTrader Types in Market Microstructure Trading\\nHarris (1998) identiﬁes three types of traders:\\n1.

Value-motivated traders, who wait for security prices to become cheap\\nrelative to their proprietary valuations of security based on fundamen-\\ntal indicators\\nInformed traders possess private information that allows them to pre-\\ndict future price changes in a particular security. Private information can\\ninclude analyses from paid-for news sources, like Bloomberg, not yet avail-\\nable to the general public, and superior forecasts based on market mi-\\ncrostructure. Informed traders are often high-frequency money managers\\nand other proprietary traders with superior access to information and skill\\nin assessing immediate market situations. The informed traders’ private\\ninformation can make a signiﬁcant impact on the market. As a result, in-\\nformed traders are impatient and typically execute their orders at market\\nprices or at prices close to market (see Vega [2007]). Alam and Tkatch\\n(2007) ﬁnd that institutional orders are more likely to be market orders\\nas opposed to limit orders, potentially reﬂecting advanced information and\\nskill of institutional money managers.\\nLiquidity (or uninformed) traders specialize in crafting order submis-\\nsion strategies in an effort to capture best prices for their customers.\\nThese traders have little proprietary information about the true value of\\nthe security they trade. Executing broker-dealers are examples of liquidity\\ntraders.\\nValue traders run models to determine the fair value of each secu-\\nrity, based on the publicly available information. Value traders might be\\ntraditional, low-frequency, institutional money managers; individual day-\\ntraders; or high-frequency managers running high-frequency fundamental\\nmodels.\\nThese three types of traders decide when to submit a market order as\\nopposed to a limit order and at what price to submit a limit order. Such\\ndecisions are optimized to minimize trading costs and maximize portfolio\\nreturns.\\nAccording to Harris (1998), market orders and aggressively priced limit\\norders are placed by impatient traders, those with material market infor-\\nmation about to become public. Limit orders that are far away from the\\ncurrent market price are typically placed by value traders, those seeking\\nto obtain bargain prices. The remaining limit orders are placed by unin-\\nformed liquidity traders who are attempting to proﬁt from making markets\\nand from detecting and following short-term price momentum. Figure 10.2\\nillustrates the distributions of order aggressiveness and trader types rela-\\ntive to the market price in the limit order book.

Bloomﬁeld, O’Hara, and\\nSaar (2005) discuss how informed investors are natural liquidity providers.\\nBecause the informed investors know the true value of an asset, they are\\nthe ﬁrst to know when the prices have adjusted to the levels at which the\\nlimit orders cannot be picked off by other traders. Measures of aggressive-\\nness of the order ﬂow may capture informed traders’ information and facil-\\nitate generation of short-term proﬁts.\\nLiquidity Provision\\nLimit orders provide market liquidity. As such, limit orders may fare better\\nin lower-liquidity markets. The extent of market liquidity available can be\\nassessed using one or more of the following measures:\\n1. The tightness of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread indicates\\nthe cost of instantaneous reversal of a given position for a standard\\ntrading amount, or “clip.”\\n2. Market depth. The depth of the market is the size of all limit orders\\nposted at the current market price (the best limit price).

These imbalances are due to differences between the individual\\ntrader and the way a dealer optimizes his order ﬂow, which may reﬂect un-\\nderlying differences in budgets, risk appetite, access to markets, and a host\\nof other idiosyncrasies. The individual trader optimization problems them-\\nselves are less important than the aggregated order imbalances that these\\noptimization differences help create. In the Garman (1976) model, the mar-\\nket has one monopolistic market maker (dealer). The market maker is re-\\nsponsible for deciding on and then setting bid and ask prices, receiving all\\norders, and clearing trades. The market maker’s objective is to maximize\\nproﬁts while avoiding bankruptcy or failure. The latter arise whenever the\\nmarket maker has no inventory or cash. Both buy and sell orders arrive as\\nindependent stochastic processes.\\nThe model solution for optimal bid and ask prices lies in the estimation\\nof the rates at which a unit of cash (e.g., a dollar or a “clip” of 10 million\\nin FX) “arrives” to the market maker when a customer comes in to buy\\nsecurities (pays money to the dealer) and “departs” the market maker when\\na customer comes in to sell (the dealer pays the customer). Suppose the\\nprobability of an arrival, a customer order to buy a security at the market\\nask price pa is denoted λa. Correspondingly, the probability of departure\\nof a clip from the market maker to the customer, or a customer order to\\nsell securities to the market maker at the bid price pb, can be denoted λb.\\nGarman (1976) proposes a simple but effective model for the minimum bid-\\nask spreads necessary in order for the market maker to remain viable.\\nThe model’s solution is based on the solution to a classical problem\\nknown as the Gambler’s Ruin Problem. In the dealer’s version of the Gam-\\nbler’s Ruin Problem, a gambler, or a dealer, starts out with a certain initial\\nwealth position and wagers (stays in business) until he loses all his money.\\nThis version of the Gambler’s Ruin Problem is known as an unbounded\\nproblem. The bounded problem assumes that the gambler bets until he ei-\\nther loses all his money or reaches a certain level of wealth, at which point\\nhe exits.\\nUnder the Gambler’s Ruin Problem, the probability that the gambler\\nwill lose all his money is\\nPrFailu re =\\n( Pr(Loss) × Loss\\nPr(Gain) × Gain\\n) Initial W ealth\\n(10.3)\\nwhere Initial Wealth is the gambler’s start-up cash, Pr(Loss) is the proba-\\nbility of losing an amount ( Loss) of the initial wealth, and Pr( Gain)i st h e\\nprobability of gaining an amount (Gain).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3c0e02e4-088b-45e9-8750-35d406a4f25b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '150', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc10 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:53 Printer: Yet to come\\n136 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nFrom the Gambler’s Ruin Problem, we can see that the probability of\\nfailure is always positive. It can be further shown that failure is certain\\nwhenever the probability of losing exceeds the probability of gaining. In\\nother words, the minimum condition for a positive probability of avoiding\\nfailure in the long term is Pr(Gain) > Pr(Loss).\\nGarman (1976) applies the Gambler’s Ruin Problem to the market-\\nmaking business in the following two ways:\\n1. The market maker fails if he runs out of cash.\\n2. The market maker fails if he runs out of inventory and is unable to\\nsatisfy client demand.\\nIn modeling the Gambler’s Ruin Problem for the market maker’s ruin\\nthrough running out of inventory, we assume that both the Gain and Loss\\nvariables are single units of the underlying ﬁnancial asset. In other words,\\nGain = 1\\nLoss = 1\\nIn the case of equity, this unit may be a share of stock. In the case\\nof foreign exchange, the unit may be a clip. Then, from the market maker’s\\nperspective, the probability of “losing” one unit of inventory is the probabil-\\nity of selling a unit of inventory, and it equals the probability λa of a buyer\\narriving. By the same logic, the probability of gaining one unit of inven-\\ntory is λb, the probability of a seller arriving. The Gambler’s Ruin Problem\\nequation (1) now becomes\\nlim\\nt→∞\\nPrFailu re(t) ≈\\n( λa\\nλb\\n) In itial Wealth/E0(pa,pb)\\n, if λb >λ a\\n= 1, otherwise.\\n(10.4)\\nwhere E0(pa, pb) is the initial average price of an underlying unit of inven-\\ntory and\\nInitial Wealth\\nE0(pa, pb)\\nis the initial number of units of the ﬁnancial instrument in possession of\\nthe market maker.\\nThe Gambler’s Ruin Problem is further applied to the market maker’s\\nprobability of failure due to running out of cash.

As a result, the market maker’s prob-\\nability of gaining a dollar is pa. Similarly, the market maker’s probability\\nof “losing” or giving away a dollar to a seller of the security for selling the\\nsecurity at price pb is λb. The Gambler’s Ruin Problem now takes the fol-\\nlowing shape:\\nlim\\nt→∞\\nPrFailu re(t) ≈\\n( λb pb\\nλa pa\\n) In itial Wealth\\n, if λa pa >λ b pb\\n= 1, otherwise\\n(10.5)\\nFor a market maker to remain in business, the ﬁrst conditions of equa-\\ntions (10.4) and (10.5) need to be satisﬁed simultaneously. In other words,\\nthe following two inequalities have to hold contemporaneously:\\nλb >λ a and λa pa >λ b pb\\nFor both inequalities to hold at the same time, the following must be true\\nat all times:pa > pb, deﬁning the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread al-\\nlows the market maker to earn cash while maintaining sufﬁcient inventory\\npositions.\\nOther inventory models assume more detailed speciﬁcations for the\\nmarket maker’s objectives and constraints. For example, Stoll (1978) as-\\nsumes that the main objective of the dealer is not only to stay in business\\nbut to effectively manage his portfolio in the face of market pressures. The\\nbid-ask spread is the market maker’s reward for bearing the costs of mar-\\nket making. These costs arise from the following three sources:\\n1. Inventory costs—the market maker often is left holding a suboptimal\\nposition in order to satisfy market demand for liquidity.\\n2. Order processing costs speciﬁc to the market maker’s own trading\\nmechanism—these costs may involve exchange fees, settlement and\\ntrade clearing costs, and transfer taxes, among other charges.\\n3. The information asymmetry cost—a market maker trading with well-\\ninformed traders may often be forced into a disadvantaged trading\\nposition.\\nAs a result, Stoll’s (1978) model predicts that the differences in bid-\\nask spreads between different market makers are a function of the market\\nmakers’ respective risk tolerances and execution set-ups.\\nIn Ho and Stoll (1981), the market maker determines bid and ask prices\\nso as to maximize wealth while minimizing risk. The market maker controls\\nhis starting wealth positions, as well as the amounts of cash and inventory\\nheld on the book at any given time.

In\\nthe outcome of the Ho and Stoll (1981) model, the market maker’s spreads\\ndepend on the his time horizon. For example, as the market maker nears\\nthe end of the day, the possible changes in positions become smaller, and\\nconsequently the market maker’s risk of carrying a position decreases.\\nTherefore, the market maker may lower the spread towards the end of the\\nday. On the other hand, when the market maker’s time horizon increases,\\nhe increases the spread to be compensated for a higher probability of an\\nadverse movement to the market maker’s book positions.\\nAvellaneda and Stoikov (2008) transform Garman’s model into a quan-\\ntitative market-making limit order book strategy that generates persistent\\npositive returns. Furthermore, the strategy outperforms the “best-bid-best-\\nask” market-making strategy where the trader posts limit orders at the\\nbest bid and ask available on the market. For fully rational, “risk-neutral”\\ntraders, the strategy of Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008) also outperforms\\nthe “symmetric” bid and ask strategy whereby the trader places bid and\\nask limit orders that are equidistant from the current mid-market price.\\nAvellaneda and Stoikov (2008) focus on the effects of inventory risk\\nand derive the optimal bid and ask limit prices for the market maker, given\\nthe following six parameters:\\nr The frequency of new bid quotes, λb. For example, λb can be ﬁve\\nper minute. The frequency of bid quotes can be thought of as demand\\nfor a given security as it reﬂects the arrival of new sellers.\\nr The frequency of new ask quotes, λa. The frequency of ask quotes\\ncan be thought of as an indicator of supply of a given security and the\\nprobability that new buyers will emerge.\\nr The latest change in frequency of new bid quotes, /Delta1λb. For ex-\\nample, if 5 bid quotes arrived during the last minute, but 10 bid quotes\\narrived during the previous minute, then the change in the bid arrival\\nfrequency is /Delta1λb = (5 − 10)/10 = –0.5.\\nr The latest change in frequency of new ask quotes, /Delta1λa. For ex-\\nample, if 5 ask quotes arrived during the last minute, and 5 ask quotes\\narrived during the previous minute, then the change in the ask arrival\\nfrequency is /Delta1λa = (5 − 5)/5 = 0.\\nr The relative risk aversion of the trader, γ.

In panel (a), market price is “pushed” by a large concentra-\\ntion of conservative limit orders.\\nCao, Hansch, and Wang (2004) ﬁnd that the shape of the limit order\\nbook is actively exploited by market-making traders. Cao, Hansch, and\\nWang (2004) also ﬁnd that the breadth and depth (also known as the length\\nand height) of the limit order book predicts 30 percent of the impending\\nprice moves. Furthermore, the asymmetry in the order book generates ad-\\nditional information. Handa, Schwartz, and Tiwari (2003) ﬁnd that the bid-\\nask spread is greater in “balanced” markets when the number of buyers\\nand sellers is comparable; conversely, the bid-ask spread is lower when-\\never the number of traders on one side of the trading equation exceeds the\\nnumber of traders on the other side. According to Handa, Schwartz, and\\nTiwari (2003), this imbalance effect stems from the fact that the few traders\\non the sparse trading side exert greater market power and obtain better\\nprices from the investors on the populous trading side who are desperate\\nto trade.\\nRosu (2005) determines that the shape of the limit order book depends\\non the probability distribution for arriving market orders. High probabil-\\nities of large market orders lead to hump-shaped limit order books.

Yet, technical analysis is more popular in some markets\\nthan in others; for example, many foreign exchange traders actively use\\ntechnical analysis, while proportionally fewer equity traders do.\\nAn interesting new application of technical analysis has been uncov-\\nered by Kavajecz and Odders-White (2004). The authors ﬁnd that techni-\\ncal analysis may provide information about the shape of the limit book.\\nSpeciﬁcally, Kavajecz and Odders-White (2004) ﬁnd that traders are more\\nlikely to place limit orders at the technical support and resistance lev-\\nels. Thus, the support and resistance indicators pinpoint the liquidity\\npeaks in the limit order book. This ﬁnding may be particularly helpful to\\nultra–high-frequency traders working in opaque or dark markets.\\nIn addition, Kavajecz and Odders-White (2004) ﬁnd that indicators\\nbased on moving averages help identify the skewness of the order book.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='89a7d91d-5709-4967-bacc-2cf8d0f82b0d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '157', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc10 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:53 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 143\\nWhen a short-run moving average rises above a long-run moving aver-\\nage, the buy-side liquidity pool in the limit order book moves closer to\\nthe market price. In this sense, moving average indicators help determine\\nthe skewness of the limit order book. Kavajecz and Odders-White (2004)\\nspeculate that the popularity of technical analysis in foreign exchange is\\ndriven by the absence of a centralized limit order book in the foreign ex-\\nchange market. The authors believe that technical analysis helps traders\\nreverse-engineer limit order books and deploy proﬁtable liquidity provision\\nstrategies.\\nCONCLUSION\\nHow does one take advantage of the opportunities present at ultra-high fre-\\nquencies? First, a thorough econometric analysis of past short-term price\\nand order book variability can be used to reveal a set of relationships that\\ncan be traded upon. Next, traders can simultaneously submit vectors of\\nmarket and limit orders to promptly react to random ﬂuctuations in buy-\\ning and selling interest. The uncertainty in the timing of execution of limit\\norders, however, must be competently managed because it leads to ran-\\ndom slippage in traders’ portfolios, introducing a potentially undesirable\\nstochastic dimension to their portfolio holdings.\\nLiquidity provision is not only proﬁtable but is also an important func-\\ntion. As Parlour and Seppi (2008) note, valuation of publicly traded assets\\nis a “social activity,” strengthening the connection between liquidity and\\nasset prices. Thus, trading activity creates value to investors who wish to\\nreallocate their portfolios in response to changes in their personal valua-\\ntions of assets.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3c5370ae-3032-4a85-b0a8-c3212fcb4fda', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '158', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc10 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:53 Printer: Yet to come\\n144', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8cd873ed-48de-4cbd-8406-51d5bb8a951d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '159', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nCHAPTER 11\\nTrading on\\nMarket\\nMicrostructure\\nInformation Models\\nI\\nnventory models, discussed in Chapter 10, propose ways in which a\\nmarket maker can set limit order prices based on characteristics of\\nthe market maker such as inventory (limit order book) and risk prefer-\\nences. As such, inventory models do not account for motivations of other\\nmarket participants. The dynamics relating to the trading rationale and ac-\\ntions of other market participants, however, can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the\\nmarket maker’s behavior.\\nInformation models speciﬁcally address the intent and future actions\\nof various market participants. Information models include game-theoretic\\napproaches to reverse-engineer quote and trade ﬂows to discover the infor-\\nmation a market maker possesses. Information models also use observed\\nor inferred order ﬂow to make informed trading decisions.\\nAt their core, information models describe trading on information ﬂow\\nand possible informational asymmetries arising during the dissemination\\nof information. Differences in information ﬂow persist in different mar-\\nkets. Information ﬂow is comparably faster in transparent centralized mar-\\nkets, such as most equity markets and electronic markets, and slower in\\nthe opaque markets, such as foreign exchange and OTC markets in bonds\\nand derivatives.\\nThe main outcome of information models is that the bid-ask spreads\\npersist even when the market maker has unlimited inventory and is able\\nto absorb any trading request instantaneously.

According to Dennis and Weston (2001) and Odders-White\\nand Ready (2006), the following measures of asymmetric information have\\nbeen proposed over the years:\\nr Quoted bid-ask spread\\nr Effective bid-ask spread\\nr Information-based impact\\nr Adverse-selection components of the bid-ask spread\\nr Probability of informed trading\\nQuoted Bid-Ask Spread\\nThe quoted bid-ask spread is the crudest, yet most readily observable mea-\\nsure of asymmetric information. First suggested by Bagehot (1971) and\\nlater developed by numerous researchers, the bid-ask spread reﬂects the\\nexpectations of market movements by the market maker using asymmet-\\nric information. When the quoting dealer receives order ﬂow that he sus-\\npects may come from an informed trader and may leave the dealer at a\\ndisadvantage relative to the market movements, the dealer increases the\\nspread he quotes in order to compensate himself against potentially ad-\\nverse uncertainty in price movements. As a result, the wider the quoted\\nbid-ask spread, the higher the dealer’s estimate of information asymmetry\\nbetween his clients and the dealer himself. Given that the dealer has the\\nsame access to public information as do most of the dealer’s clients, the\\nquoted bid-ask spread may serve as a measure of asymmetric information\\navailable in the market at large at any given point in time.\\nEffective Bid-Ask Spread\\nThe effective bid-ask spread is computed as twice the difference between\\nthe latest trade price and the midpoint between the quoted bid and ask', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='89a7c9c2-327a-4d85-9449-eb025d07e6ba', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '161', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 147\\nprices, divided by the midpoint between the quoted bid and ask prices. The\\neffective spread, therefore, produces a measure that is virtually identical\\nto the quoted bid-ask spread but reﬂects the actual order book and allows\\ncomparison among ﬁnancial instruments with various price levels.\\nInformation-Based Impact\\nThe information-based impact measure of asymmetric information is at-\\ntributable to Hasbrouck (1991). Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996) spec-\\nify the following vector autoregressive (VAR) model for estimation of the\\ninformation-based impact measure,λ:\\nVi,t = θi,0 +\\nK∑\\nk=1\\nβi,k/Delta1Pi,t−k +\\nM∑\\nm=1\\nγi,mVi,t−m + τi,t (11.1)\\n/Delta1Pi,t = φi,0 + φi,1sign(/Delta1Pi,t) + λiτi,t + εi,t (11.2)\\nwhere /Delta1Pi,t is the change in price of security i from time t − 1t ot i m et,\\nVi,t = sign(/Delta1Pi,t) · vi,t, and vi,t is the volume recorded in trading the secu-\\nrity i from time t − 1t ot i m et. Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996) propose\\nﬁve lags in estimation of equation (1): K = M = 5.\\nAdverse Selection Components of the\\nBid-Ask Spread\\nThe adverse selection components of the bid-ask spread is attributable to\\nGlosten and Harris (1988). The model separates the bid-ask spread into the\\nfollowing three components:\\nr Adverse selection risk\\nr Order-processing costs\\nr Inventory risk\\nModels in a similar spirit were proposed by Roll (1984); Stoll (1989);\\nand George, Kaul, and Nimalendran (1991). The version of the Glosten and\\nHarris (1988) model popularized by Huang and Stoll (1997) aggregates in-\\nventory risk and order-processing costs and is speciﬁed as follows:\\n/Delta1Pi,t = (1 − λi) Si,t\\n2 sign(/Delta1Pi,t) + λi\\nSi,t\\n2 sign(/Delta1Pi,t) · vi,t + εi,t (11.3)\\nwhere /Delta1Pi,t is the change in price of security i from time t − 1t ot i m et,\\nVi,t = sign(/Delta1Pi,t) · vi,t, vi,t is the volume recorded in trading the security i', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a9a78e1e-99d6-4fee-ade5-f725e18bdb0f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '162', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\n148 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nfrom time t-1t ot i m et, Si,t is the effective bid-ask spread as deﬁned previ-\\nously, and λi is the fraction of the traded spread due to adverse selection.\\nProbability of Informed Trading\\nEasley, Kiefer, O’Hara, and Paperman (1996) propose a model to distill\\nthe likelihood of informed trading from sequential quote data. The model\\nreverse-engineers the quote sequence provided by a dealer to obtain a prob-\\nabilistic idea of the order ﬂow seen by the dealer.\\nThe model is built on the following concept: Suppose an event occurs\\nthat is bound to impact price levels but is observable only to a select group\\nof investors. Such an event may be a controlled release of selected infor-\\nmation or a research ﬁnding by a brilliant analyst. The probability of such\\nan event is α. Furthermore, suppose that if the event occurs, the probabil-\\nity of its having a negative effect on prices is δ and the probability of the\\nevent having a positive effect on prices is (1-δ). When the event occurs, in-\\nformed investors know of the impact the event is likely to have on prices;\\nthey then place trades according to their knowledge at a rate µ. Thus, all\\nthe investors informed of the event will place orders on the same side of\\nthe market—either buys or sells. At the same time, investors uninformed\\nof the event will keep placing orders on both sides of the market at a rate\\nω. The probability of informed trading taking place is then determined as\\nfollows:\\nPI = αµ\\nαµ + 2ω (11.4)\\nThe parameters α, µ, and ω are then estimated from the following likeli-\\nhood function over T periods of time:\\nL(B, S|α, µ, ω, δ) =\\nT∏\\nt=1\\nℓ( B, S,t|α, µ, ω, δ) (11.5)\\nwhere ℓ( B, S,t|α, µ, ω, δ) is the daily likelihood of observing B buys and S\\nsells:\\nℓ( B, S,t|α, µ, ω, δ) = (1 − α)\\n[\\nexp(−ωT)(ωT)B\\nB!\\n][\\nexp(−ωT)(ωT)S\\nS!\\n]\\n+α(1 − δ)\\n[\\nexp(−(ω + µ)T)((ω + µ)T)B\\nB!\\n][\\nexp(−ωT)(ωT)S\\nS!\\n]\\n+αδ\\n[\\nexp(−ωT)(ωT)B\\nB!\\n][\\nexp(−(ω + µ)T)((ω + µ)T)S\\nS!\\n]\\n(11.6)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='d2a4b51f-8733-403f-9328-0fea6fd20cd0', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '163', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 149\\nINFORMATION-BASED\\nTRADING MODELS\\nTrading on Information Contained in\\nBid-Ask Spreads\\nLiquidity-providing market participants (or market makers) use bid-ask\\nspreads as compensation for bearing the costs of market making. These\\ncosts arise from the following four sources:\\n1. Order-processing costs. Order-processing costs are speciﬁc to the\\nmarket maker’s own trading platform. These costs may involve ex-\\nchange fees, settlement and trade clearing costs, transfer taxes, and\\nthe like. To transfer the order-processing costs to their counterparties,\\nmarket makers simply increase the bid-ask spread by the amount it\\ncosts market makers to process the orders.\\n2. Inventory costs. Market makers often ﬁnd themselves holding sub-\\noptimal positions in order to satisfy market demand for liquidity. They\\ntherefore increase the bid-ask spreads they quote to their counterpar-\\nties to slow down further accumulation of adverse positions, at least\\nuntil they are able to distribute their inventory among other market\\nparticipants.\\n3. Information asymmetry costs. A market maker trading with well-\\ninformed traders may often be forced into a disadvantageous trading\\nposition. For example, if a well-informed trader is able to correctly\\nforecast that EUR/JPY is about to increase by 1 percent, then the well-\\ninformed trader buys a certain amount of EUR/JPY from the market\\nmaker, leaving the market maker holding a short position in EUR/JPY\\nin the face of rising EUR/JPY. To hedge his risk of ending up in such\\nsituations, the market maker widens the bid-ask spreads for all of his\\ncounterparties, informed and uninformed alike. The bid-ask spread\\non average compensates for the market maker’s risk of being at a\\ndisadvantage.\\n4. Time-horizon risk. Most market makers are evaluated on the basis of\\ntheir daily performance, with a typical trading day lasting eight hours.\\nAt the end of each trading day, the market maker closes his position\\nbook or transfers the book to another market maker who takes the\\nresponsibility and makes decisions on all open positions. At the begin-\\nning of each trading shift, a market maker faces the risk that each of\\nhis open market positions may move considerably in the adverse di-\\nrection by the end of the day if left unattended.

If bid-ask spreads were to compensate the dealer for the risks as-\\nsociated with holding excess inventory, then any changes in prices would\\nbe temporary. If all orders were to carry information that led to permanent\\nprice changes, the bid-ask spreads would compensate the dealer for the\\npotential risk of encountering adverse asymmetric information.\\nAnalyzing the bid-ask spreads of the market maker gives clues to the\\nposition sizes of the market maker’s inventory and allows the market\\nmaker to estimate the order ﬂow faced by the market maker. Unexpectedly\\nwidening spreads may signal that the market maker has received and is pro-\\ncessing large positions. These positions may be placed by well-informed\\ninstitutional traders and may indicate the direction of the security price\\nmovement in the near future. Information about future price movements\\nextracted from the bid-ask spreads may then serve as reliable forecasts of\\ndirection of upcoming price changes.\\nGains achieved in the markets are due either to market activity or to\\ntrading activity. Market gains, also referred to as capital gains, are com-\\nmon to most long-term investors. When markets go up, so do the gains of\\nmost investors long in the markets; the opposite occurs when the markets\\ngo down. Over time, as markets rise and fall, market investors expect to\\nreceive the market rate of return on average. As ﬁrst noted by Bagehot\\n(1971), however, the presence of short-term speculative traders may skew\\nthe realized return values.\\nIf a market maker knew for sure that a speciﬁc trader had superior\\ninformation, that market maker could raise the spread for that trader\\nalone. However, most traders trade on probabilities of speciﬁc events\\noccurring and cannot be distinguished ahead of closing their positions\\nfrom uninformed market participants. To compensate for the informed\\ntrader–related losses, the market maker will extract higher margins from\\nall of his clients by raising the bid-ask spread. As a result, in the presence\\nof well-informed traders, both well-informed and less-informed market par-\\nticipants bear higher bid-ask spreads.\\nImportant research on the topic is documented in Glosten and\\nMilgrom (1985). The authors model how informed traders’ orders incor-\\nporate and distribute information within a competitive market. At the fun-\\ndamental level, traders who have bad news about a particular ﬁnancial se-\\ncurity ahead of the market will sell that security, and traders with good\\nnews will buy the security. However, well-informed traders may also buy\\nand sell to generate liquidity. Depending on the type of the order the mar-\\nket maker receives (either a buy or a sell), the market maker will adjust his\\nbeliefs about the impending direction of the market for a particular ﬁnan-\\ncial security.

For example,\\nmarket participants such as long-term investors uninformed of the true\\nvalue of the security one minute from now may have a pretty good idea\\nof the true value of the security one day from now. These uninformed in-\\nvestors are therefore willing to trade with an informed trader now even\\nthough in just one minute the investors could get a better price, unbe-\\nknownst to them at present. In the foreign exchange market, uninformed\\nmarket participants such as multinational corporations may choose to\\ntrade to hedge their foreign exchange exposure.\\nThe informed traders’ information gets impounded into prices by the\\nmarket maker. When a market maker receives an order, the market maker\\nreevaluates his beliefs about the true value of the ﬁnancial security based\\non the parameters of the order. The order parameters may be the action\\n(buy or sell), limit price if any, order quantity, leverage or margin, and the\\ntrader’s prior success rate, among other order characteristics. The process\\nof incorporating new information into prior beliefs that the market maker\\nundergoes with every order is often modeled according to the Bayes rule.\\nUpdating beliefs according to the Bayes rule is known as Bayesian learning.\\nComputer algorithms employing Bayesian learning are often referred to as\\ngenetic algorithms.\\n“In Praise of Bayes,” an article in the The Economist from September\\n40, 2000, describes Bayesian learning as follows:\\nThe essence of the Bayesian approach is to provide a mathematical\\nrule explaining how you should change your existing beliefs in the\\nlight of new evidence. In other words, it allows scientists to combine\\nnew data with their existing knowledge or expertise. The canoni-\\ncal example is to imagine that a precocious newborn observes his\\nﬁrst sunset, and wonders whether the sun will rise again or not. He\\nassigns equal prior probabilities to both possible outcomes, and rep-\\nresents this by placing one white and one black marble into a bag.\\nThe following day, when the sun rises, the child places another white\\nmarble in the bag. The probability that a marble plucked randomly\\nfrom the bag will be white (i.e., the child’s degree of belief in future\\nsunrises) has thus gone from a half to two-thirds.

Gradually, the initial belief that the sun is just as likely\\nas not to rise each morning is modiﬁed to become a near-certainty\\nthat the sun will always rise.\\nMathematically, the Bayes rule can be speciﬁed as follows:\\nPr(seeing data) = Pr(seeing data | event occurred) Pr(event occurred)\\n+ Pr(seeing data | no event) Pr(no event) (11.7)\\nwhere Pr(event) may refer to the probability of the sun rising again or the\\nprobability of security prices rising, while seeing may refer to registering a\\nbuy order or actually observing the sunrise. No event may refer to a lack of\\nbuy orders or inability to observe a sunrise on a particular day—for exam-\\nple, due to a cloudy sky. The probability of seeing data and registering an\\nevent at the same time has the following symmetric property:\\nPr(seeing data, event) = Pr(event|seeing data) Pr(seeing data)\\n= Pr(seeing data|event) Pr(event) (11.8)\\nRearranging equation (11.8) to obtain expression for Pr(event|seeing data)\\nand then substituting Pr (seeing data) from equation (1) produces the\\nfollowing result:\\nPr(event|seeing data) =\\nPr(seeing data|event) Pr(event)\\nPr(seeing data|event) Pr(event) + Pr(seeing data|no event) Pr(no event)\\n(11.9)\\nEquation (11.9) is known as the Bayes rule, and it can be rewritten as\\nfollows:\\nPosterior belief = Pr(event|seeing data)\\n= Prior belief × Pr(seeing data|event)\\nMarginal likelihood of the data (11.10)\\nMarket makers apply the Bayes rule after each order event, whether\\nthey consciously calculate probabilities or unconsciously use their trad-\\ning experience.

At what level\\nshould the market maker set bid and ask prices?\\nAccording to the Bayes rule, the market maker should set the new ask\\nprice to the expected Vask, given the buy order: E[Vask|buy order]. Sup-\\npose that the market maker cannot distinguish between informed and un-\\ninformed traders and assigns a 50 percent probability to the event that a\\nmarket buy order will arrive from an informed trader and a 50 percent\\nprobability to the event that a market buy order will arrive from an unin-\\nformed trader. In addition, suppose that any informed trader would place\\na buy order only if the trader was certain he could make at least 5 pips\\non each trade in excess of the bid-ask spread and that there are no other\\ntransaction costs. If the average bid-ask spread on AUD/USD quoted by the\\nmarket maker is 2 pips, then an informed trader would place a buy order\\nonly if he believes that the true value of AUD/USD is at least 0.6738. From\\nthe market maker’s perspective, the Bayesian probability of the true value\\nof AUD/USD,Vask, being worth 0.6738 after observing a buy order is calcu-\\nlated as follows:\\nPr(Vask = 0.6738|buy order) =\\nPr(Vask = 0.6738) Pr(buy order|Vask = 0.6738)\\nPr(Vask = 0.6731) Pr(buy order|Vask = 0.6731)\\n+Pr(Vask = 0.6738) Pr(buy order|Vask = 0.6738)\\n(11.11)\\nIf the true value Vask is indeed 0.6738, then an informed trader places\\nthe buy order with certainty (a probability of 100 percent), while the unin-\\nformed trader may place a buy order with a probability of 50 percent (also\\nwith a probability of 50 percent, the uninformed trader may place a sell\\norder instead). Thus, if the true price Vask = 0.6738,\\nPr(buy order|Vask = 0.6738) = Pr(informed trader) ∗ 100 percent\\n+Pr(uninformed trader)∗50 percent\\n(11.12)\\nSince we previously assumed that the market maker cannot distinguish\\nbetween informed and uninformed traders and assigns equal probability to\\neither,\\nPr(informed trader) = Pr(uninformed trader) = 50 percent (11.13)\\nCombining equations (11.12) and (11.13), we obtain the following proba-\\nbility of the buy order being an indication of the buy order resulting from\\nhigher true value Vask:', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='229318c0-fc1c-4d60-a581-98d7889498bd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '169', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 155\\nPr(buy order|Vask = 0.6738) = 50 percent∗100 percent\\n+50 percent∗ 50 percent (11.14)\\n= 75 percent.\\nThe probability of the buy order resulting from the lower, unchanged, true\\nvalue Vask is then\\nPr(buy order|Vask = 0.6731) = 1− Pr(buy order|Vask = 0.6738)\\n= 25 percent.

He sets the price equal to the conditional expected\\nvalue as follows:\\nNew ask price = E[V |buy order] = 0.6731 × Pr(Vask = 0.6731)\\n+0.6738 × Pr(Vask = 0.6738) (11.17)\\n= 0.6731 × 25% + 0.6738 × 75% = 0.6736\\nSimilarly, a new bid price can be calculated as E[Vbid|sellorder] after ob-\\nserving a sell order. The resulting bid and ask values are tradable “regret-\\nfree” quotes.

The\\nmarket maker will now once again adjust his bid and ask prices conditional\\non such expectation.\\nOne outcome of Glosten and Milgrom (1985) is that in the presence of\\na large number of informed traders, a market maker will set unreasonably\\nhigh spreads in order to break even. As a result, no trades will occur and\\nthe market will shut down.\\nIn Glosten and Milgrom (1985) all trades are done on one unit of the\\nﬁnancial security. Glosten and Milgrom (1985) do not consider the im-\\npact that the trade size has on price. Easley and O’Hara (1987) extend the\\nGlosten and Milgrom model to incorporate varying trade sizes. Easley and\\nO’Hara (1987) further add one more level of complexity—information ar-\\nrives with probability α. Still, both Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and Easley\\nand O’Hara are models in which informed traders simply submit orders at\\nevery trading opportunity until prices adjust to their new full-information\\nvalue. The traders do not strategically consider the optimal actions of mar-\\nket makers and how market makers may act to reduce traders’ proﬁtability.\\nBy contrast, the class of models known as strategic models develop\\nconjectures about pricing policies of the market maker and incorporate\\nthose conjectures into their trading actions. One such strategic model by\\nKyle (1985) analyzes how a single informed trader could best take advan-\\ntage of his information in order to maximize his proﬁts.\\nKyle (1985) describes how information is incorporated into security\\nprices over time. A trader with exclusive information (e.g., a good pro-\\nprietary quantitative model) hides his orders among those of uninformed\\ntraders to avoid provoking the market maker into increasing the spread or\\notherwise adjusting the price in any adverse manner.\\nMende, Menkhoff, and Osler (2006) note that the process of embedding\\ninformation into foreign exchange prices differs from the process of other\\nasset classes, say equities. Traditional microstructure theory observes four\\ncomponents contributing to the bid-ask spread: adverse selection, inven-\\ntory risk, operating costs, and occasional monopoly power. Foreign ex-\\nchange literature often excludes the possibility of monopolistic pricing in\\nthe foreign exchange markets due to decentralization of competitive for-\\neign exchange dealers. Some literature suggests that most bid-ask spreads\\narise as a function of adverse selection; dealers charge the bid-ask spread\\nto neutralize the effects of losing trades in which the counterparties are bet-\\nter informed than the dealer himself.

Mende, Menkhoff, and Osler (2006) further suggest that the deal-\\ners may be simply enjoying higher margins on corporate and commercial\\nentities than on institutional customers due to competitive pressures from\\nthe electronic marketplace in the latter markets. Mende, Menkhoff, and\\nOsler (2006) attribute this phenomenon to the relative market power of\\nforeign exchange dealers among corporate and commercial enterprises.\\nIn addition, Mende, Menkhoff, and Osler (2006) suggest that the deal-\\ners may strategically subsidize the trades that carry information, as ﬁrst\\nnoted by Leach and Madhavan (1992, 1993) and Naik, Neuberkert, and\\nViswanathan (1999). For example, the dealers may provide lower spreads\\non large block orders in an effort to gather information and use it in their\\nown proprietary trades.\\nMende, Menkhoff, and Osler (2006), however, emphasize that the ma-\\njority of price variations in response to customer orders occurs through\\ndealer inventory management. When the dealer transacts with an informed\\ncustomer, the dealer immediately needs to diversify the risk of ending up\\non the adverse side of the transaction. For example, if a dealer receives a\\nbuy order from an informed customer, there is a high probability that the\\nmarket price is about to rise; still, the dealer has just sold his inventory to\\nthe customer. To diversify his exposure, the dealer places a buy in the inter-\\ndealer markets. When the dealer receives a buy order from an uninformed\\ncustomer, on the other hand, the probability that the market price will rise\\nis low, and the dealer has no immediate need to diversify the exposure that\\nresults from his trading with the uninformed customer.\\nTrading on Order Aggressiveness\\nMuch of the success of microstructure trading is based on the trader’s abil-\\nity to retrieve information from observed market data.

The consensus number is typically accom-\\npanied by a range of forecasts that measures the dispersion of forecasts by\\nall analysts under consideration. For example, prior to the announcement\\nof the January 2009 month-to-month change in retail sales in the United\\nStates, Bloomberg LP reported the analysts’ consensus to be –0.8 percent,\\nwhile all the analysts’ estimates for the number ranged from –2.2 percent to\\n0.3 percent (the actual number revealed at 8:30 A.M. on February 12, 2009,\\nhappened to be +1.0 percent).\\nFoster and Viswanathan (1996) show that the correlation in the degree\\nof informativeness of various market participants affects the speed with\\nwhich information is impounded into prices, impacts proﬁts of traders pos-\\nsessing information, and also determines the ability of the market partici-\\npants to learn from each other. In other words, the narrower the analysts’\\nforecast range, the faster the market arrives at fair market prices of se-\\ncurities following a scheduled news release. The actual announcement in-\\nformation enters prices through active trading. Limit orders result in more\\nfavorable execution prices than market orders; the price advantage, how-\\never, comes at a cost—the wait and the associated risk of non-execution.\\nMarket orders, on the other hand, are executed immediately but can be\\nsubject to adverse pricing. Market orders are used in aggressive trading,\\nwhen prices are moving rapidly and quick execution must be achieved to\\ncapture and preserve trading gains. The better the trader’s information and\\nthe more aggressive his trading, the faster the information enters prices.\\nAs a result, aggressive orders may themselves convey information\\nabout the impending direction of the security price move. If a trader exe-\\ncutes immediately instead of waiting for a more favorable price, the trader\\nmay convey information about his beliefs about where the market is going.\\nVega (2007) shows that better-informed market participants trade more ag-\\ngressively. Mimicking aggressive trades, therefore, may result in a consis-\\ntently proﬁtable trading strategy. Measures of aggressiveness of the order\\nﬂow may further capture informed traders’ information and facilitate gen-\\neration of short-term proﬁts.\\nAnand, Chakravarty, and Martell (2005) ﬁnd that on the NYSE,\\ninstitutional limit orders perform better than limit orders placed by', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='58bb1a92-5fec-460a-bcc1-5e13fd87a216', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '173', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 159\\nindividuals, orders at or better than market price perform better than\\nlimit orders placed inside the bid-ask spread, and larger orders outperform\\nsmaller orders.

The autocorrelation of market aggressiveness is thought to\\noriginate from either of the following sources:\\nr Large institutional orders that are transmitted in smaller slices over an\\nextended period of time at comparable levels of market aggressiveness\\nr Simple price momentum\\nResearch into detecting autocorrelation of market aggressiveness was\\nperformed by Biais, Hillion, and Spatt (1995), who separated orders ob-\\nserved on the Paris Bourse by the degree of aggressiveness—from the least\\naggressive market orders that move prices to the most aggressive limit or-\\nders outside the current book. The authors found that the distribution of\\norders in terms of aggressiveness depends on the state of the market and\\nthat order submissions are autocorrelated. The authors detected a “diag-\\nonal effect” whereby initial orders of a certain level of aggressiveness are\\nfollowed by other orders of the same level of aggressiveness. Subsequent\\nempirical research conﬁrmed the ﬁndings for different stock exchanges.\\nSee, for example, Grifﬁths, Smith, Turnbull, and White (2000) for the\\nToronto Stock Exchange; Ranaldo (2004) for the Swiss Stock Exchange;\\nCao, Hansch, and Wang (2004) for the Australian Stock Exchange; Ahn,\\nBae, and Chan (2001) for the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong; and Handa,\\nSchwartz, and Tiwari (2003) for the CAC40 stocks traded on the Paris\\nBourse.\\nTrading on Order Flow\\nOrder Flow Overview Order ﬂow is the difference between buyer-\\ninitiated and seller-initiated trading volume. Order ﬂow has lately been of\\nparticular interest to both academics and practitioners studying the ﬂow’s\\ninformational content. According to Lyons (2001), order ﬂow is informative\\nfor three reasons:\\n1. Order ﬂow can be thought of as market participants exposing their eq-\\nuity to their own forecasts. A decision to send an order can be costly to\\nmarket participants. Order ﬂow therefore reﬂects market participants’\\nhonest beliefs about the upcoming direction of the market.\\n2. Order ﬂow data is decentralized with limited distribution; brokers see\\nthe order ﬂow of their clients and inter-dealer networks only. Clients\\nseldom see any direct order ﬂow at all, but can partially infer the order\\nﬂow information from market data provided by their brokers using a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0e796779-52bd-4282-ab12-f8bac0e75ff8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '175', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 161\\ncomplex and costly mechanism. Because the order ﬂow is not available\\nto everyone, those who possess full order ﬂow information are in a\\nunique position to exploit it before the information is impounded into\\nmarket prices.\\n3. Order ﬂow shows large and nontrivial positions that will temporarily\\nmove the market regardless of whether the originator of the trades pos-\\nsesses any superior information. Once again, an entity observing the\\norder ﬂow is best positioned to capitalize on the market movements\\nsurrounding the transaction.\\nLyons (2001) further distinguishes between transparent and opaque or-\\nder ﬂows, with transparent order ﬂows providing immediate information,\\nand opaque order ﬂows failing to produce useful data or subjective analy-\\nsis to extract market beliefs. According to Lyons (2001), order ﬂow trans-\\nparency encompasses the following three dimensions:\\nr Pre-trade versus post-trade information\\nr Price versus quantity information\\nr Public versus dealer information\\nBrokers observing the customer and inter-dealer ﬂow ﬁrsthand have\\naccess to the information pre-trade, can observe both the price and the\\nquantity of the trade, and can see both public and dealer information. On\\nthe other hand, end customers can generally see only the post-trade price\\ninformation by the time it becomes public or available to all customers.\\nUndoubtedly, dealers are much better positioned to use the wealth of in-\\nformation embedded in the order ﬂow to obtain superior returns, given the\\nappropriate resources to use the information efﬁciently.\\nOrder ﬂow information is easy to trade proﬁtably. A disproportionately\\nlarge number of buy orders will inevitably push the price of the traded secu-\\nrity higher; placing a buy order at the time a large buy volume is observed\\nwill result in positive gains. Similarly, a large number of sell orders will\\ndepress prices, and a timely sell order placed when the sell order ﬂow is\\nobserved will generate positive results.\\nOrder Flow Is Directly Observable As noted by Lyons (1995), Per-\\nraudin and Vitale (1996), and Evans and Lyons (2002), among others, or-\\nder ﬂow is a centralized measure of information that was previously dis-\\npersed among market participants. Order ﬂow for a particular ﬁnancial\\nsecurity at any given time is formally measured as the difference between\\nbuyer-initiated and seller-initiated trading interest.

When trade quantities are not directly observable, order\\nﬂow can be measured as the difference between the number of buyer-\\ninitiated trades and seller-initiated trades in each speciﬁc time interval.\\nBoth trade-size–based and number-of-trades–based measures of order\\nﬂow have been used in the empirical literature. The measures are compa-\\nrable since most orders are transmitted in “clips,” or parcels of a standard\\nsize, primarily to avoid undue attention and price run-ups that would ac-\\ncompany larger trades. Jones, Kaul, and Lipson (1994) actually found that\\norder ﬂow measured in number of trades predicts prices and volatility bet-\\nter than order ﬂow measured in aggregate size of trades.\\nThe importance of order ﬂow in arriving at a new price level follow-\\ning a news announcement has been veriﬁed empirically. Love and Payne\\n(2008), for example, examine the order ﬂow in foreign exchange surround-\\ning macroeconomic news announcements and ﬁnd that order ﬂow directly\\naccounts for at least half of all the information impounded into market\\nprices.\\nLove and Payne (2008) studied the impact of order ﬂow on three cur-\\nrency pairs: USD/EUR, GBP/EUR, and USD/GBP. The impact of the order\\nﬂow on the respective rates found by Love and Payne (2008) is shown\\nin Table 11.2. The authors measure order ﬂow as the difference between\\nthe number of buyer-initiated and the number of seller-initiated trades in\\neach 1-minute interval. Love and Payne (2008) document that at the time\\nof news release from Eurozone, each additional buyer-initiated trade in ex-\\ncess of seller-initiated trades causes USD/EUR to increase by 0.00626 or\\n0.626 percent.\\nTABLE 11.2\\nAverage Changes in 1-Minute Currency Returns Following a Single\\nTrade Increase in the Number of Buyer-Initiated Trades in Excess of\\nSeller-Initiated Trades\\nUSD/EUR\\nReturn\\nGBP/EUR\\nReturn\\nUSD/GBP\\nReturn\\nFlowt at a time coinciding with a news\\nrelease from Eurozone\\n0.00626* 0.000544 0.00206\\nFlowt at a time coinciding with a news\\nrelease from the UK\\n0.000531 0.00339 *** 0.00322***\\nFlowt at a time coinciding with a news\\nrelease from the U.S.\\n0.00701*** 0.00204 0.00342 **\\n***, ** and * denote 99.9 percent, 95 percent, and 90 percent statistical\\nsigniﬁcance, respectively.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9b87d9da-028e-48e3-b5ad-4db53196b802', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '177', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc11 JWBT188-Aldridge October 29, 2009 16:54 Printer: Yet to come\\nTrading on Market Microstructure 163\\nOrder Flow Is Not Directly Observable Order ﬂow is not necessar-\\nily transparent to all market participants. For example, executing brokers\\ncan directly observe buy-and-sell orders coming from their customers, but\\ngenerally the customers can see only the bid and offer prices, and, possibly,\\nthe depth of the market.\\nAs a result, various models have sprung up to extract order ﬂow infor-\\nmation from the observable data. Most of these models are based on the\\nfollowing principle: the aggregate number of buy orders dominates the ag-\\ngregate number of sell orders for a particular security whenever the price\\nof that security rises, and vice versa. Hasbrouck (1991) proposes the fol-\\nlowing identiﬁcation of order ﬂow, adjusted for orders placed in previous\\ntime periods and conditioned on the time of day:\\nxi,t = αx +\\nK∑\\nk=1\\nβkri,t−k +\\nM∑\\nm=1\\nγmxt−m +\\nT∑\\nt=1\\nδDt + εi,t (11.18)\\nwhere xi,t is the aggregate order ﬂow for a security i at time t, equal to\\n+1 for buys and –1 for sells; ri,t is a one-period return on the security i\\nfrom time t-1t ot i m et; and Dt is the dummy indicator controlling for the\\ntime of day into which timet falls. Hasbrouck (1991) considers nineteenDt\\noperators corresponding to half-hour periods between 7:30 A.M. and 5:00\\nP.M.E S T .\\nAutocorrelation of Order Flows Like market aggressiveness, order\\nﬂows exhibit autocorrelation, according to a number of articles including\\nthose by Biais, Hillion, and Spatt (1995); Foucault (1999); Parlour (1998);\\nFoucault, Kadan, and Kandel (2005); Goettler, Parlour, and Rajan (2005,\\n2007); and Rosu (2005).\\nEllul, Holden, Jain, and Jennings (2007) interpret short-term autocor-\\nrelation in high-frequency order ﬂows as waves of competing order ﬂows\\nresponding to current market events within liquidity depletion and replen-\\nishment.

The an-\\nnouncements of the U.S. Fed Funds decisions, therefore, are events that\\ncan be consistently and proﬁtably arbitraged.\\nThe goal of event arbitrage strategies is to identify portfolios that make\\npositive proﬁt over the time window surrounding each event. The time win-\\ndow is typically a time period beginning just before the event and ending\\nshortly afterwards. For events anticipated ex-ante, such as scheduled eco-\\nnomic announcements, the portfolio positions may be opened ahead of the\\nannouncement or just after the announcement. The portfolio is then fully\\nliquidated shortly after the announcement.\\nTrading positions can be held anywhere from a few seconds to several\\nhours and can result in consistently proﬁtable outcomes with low volatili-\\nties. The speed of response to an event often determines the trade gain; the\\nfaster the response, the higher the probability that the strategy will be able\\nto proﬁtably ride the momentum wave to the post-announcement equilib-\\nrium price level. As a result, event arbitrage strategies are well suited for\\nhigh-frequency applications and are most proﬁtably executed in fully auto-\\nmated trading environments.\\nDeveloping an event arbitrage trading strategy harnesses research on\\nequilibrium pricing and leverages statistical tools that assess tick-by-tick\\ntrading data and events the instant they are released. Further along in\\nthis chapter, we will survey academic research on the impact of events on\\nprices; now we investigate the mechanics of developing an event arbitrage\\nstrategy.\\nMost event arbitrage strategies follow a three-stage development\\nprocess:\\n1. For each event type, identify dates and times of past events in historical\\ndata.\\n2. Compute historical price changes at desired frequencies pertaining to\\nsecurities of interest and surrounding the events identiﬁed in Step 1.\\n3. Estimate expected price responses based on historical price behavior\\nsurrounding past events.\\nThe sources of dates and times for speciﬁed events that occurred in\\nthe past can be collected from various Internet sites. Most announcements\\nrecur at the same time of day and make the job of collecting the data\\nmuch easier. U.S. unemployment announcements, for example, are always\\nreleased at 8:30 A.M. Eastern time. Some announcements, such as those of\\nthe U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee interest rate changes, occur at\\nirregular times during the day and require greater diligence in collecting\\nthe data.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='02cd16d8-c60a-4709-a48f-56204f466553', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '181', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc12 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 20:5 Printer: Yet to come\\nEvent Arbitrage 167\\nWHAT CONSTITUTES AN EVENT?\\nThe events used in event arbitrage strategies can be any releases of news\\nabout economic activity, market disruptions, and other events that con-\\nsistently impact market prices. Classic ﬁnancial theory tells us that in\\nefﬁcient markets, the price adjusts to new information instantaneously fol-\\nlowing a news release. In practice, market participants form expectations\\nabout inﬂation ﬁgures well before the formal statistics are announced.\\nMany ﬁnancial economists are tasked with forecasting inﬂation ﬁgures\\nbased on other continuously observed market variables, such as prices\\non commodity futures and other market securities. When such forecasts\\nbecome available, market participants trade securities on the basis of the\\nforecasts, impounding their expectations into prices well before the formal\\nannouncements occur.\\nAll events do not have the same magnitude. Some events may have\\npositive and negative impacts on prices, and some events may have more\\nsevere consequences than others. The magnitude of an event can be mea-\\nsured as a deviation of the realized event ﬁgures from the expectations\\nof the event. The price of a particular stock, for example, should adjust\\nto the net present value of its future cash ﬂows following a higher- or\\nlower-than-expected earnings announcement. However, if earnings are in\\nline with investor expectations, the price should not move. Similarly, in\\nthe foreign exchange market, the level of a foreign exchange pair should\\nchange in response to an unexpected change—for example, in the level of\\nthe consumer price index (CPI) of the domestic country. If, however, the\\ndomestic CPI turns out to be in line with market expectations, little change\\nshould occur.\\nThe key objective in the estimation of news impact is the determi-\\nnation of what actually constitutes the unexpected change, or news. The\\nearliest macroeconomic event studies, such as those of Frenkel (1981) and\\nEdwards (1982), considered news to be an out-of-sample error based\\non the one-step-ahead autoregressive forecasts of the macroeconomic\\nvariable in question. The thinking went that most economic news develops\\nslowly over time, and the trend observed during the past several months\\nor quarters is the best predictor of the value to be released on the next\\nscheduled news release day.

Instead, the\\ncentral bankers adopt and follow a longer-term course of action, gradu-\\nally adjusting the ﬁgures in their control, such as interest rates and money\\nsupply, to lead the economy in the intended direction.\\nThe empirical evidence of the impact of news deﬁned in the autore-\\ngressive fashion shows that the framework indeed can be used to pre-\\ndict future movements of securities. Yet the impact is best seen in shorter\\nterms—for example, on intra-day data. Almeida, Goodhart, and Payne\\n(1998) documented a signiﬁcant effect of macroeconomic news announce-\\nments on the USD/DEM exchange rate sampled at ﬁve-minute intervals.\\nThe authors found that news announcements pertaining to the U.S. em-\\nployment and trade balance were particularly signiﬁcant predictors of ex-\\nchange rates, but only within two hours following the announcement. On\\nthe other hand, U.S. non-farm payroll and consumer conﬁdence news an-\\nnouncements caused price momentum lasting 12 hours or more following\\nan announcement.\\nLately, surprises in macroeconomic announcements have been mea-\\nsured relative to published averages of economists’ forecasts. For example,\\nevery weekBarron’sand the Wall Street Journal publish consensus fore-\\ncasts for the coming week’s announcements. The forecasts are developed\\nfrom a survey of ﬁeld economists.\\nFORECASTING METHODOLOGIES\\nDirectional and point forecasts are the two approaches to estimating\\nthe price response to an announcement. A directional forecast predicts\\nwhether the price of a particular security will go up or down, whereas a\\npoint forecast predicts the level to which the new price will go. The fol-\\nlowing two sections consider directional and point forecast methodologies\\nin detail. The last section of the chapter discusses event study results that\\nhave been documented in the academic literature to date.\\nDirectional Forecasts\\nDirectional forecasts of the post-event price movement of the security\\nprice can be created using the sign test.

When the U.S. inﬂation rate rises, USD/CAD is expected to\\nincrease instantaneously, and vice versa.

This post-announcement adjustment, therefore, presents a\\nconsistent proﬁt-taking opportunity.\\nSplitting the data into 30-second intervals, we observe that the num-\\nber of tradable opportunities increases further. For announcements of\\nrising inﬂation, the price adjustment now occurs in four 30-second post-\\nannouncement intervals. For the announcements showing a decrease in\\ninﬂation, the price adjustment occurs in one 30-second post-announcement\\ntime interval.\\nExamining 15-second intervals, we note an even higher number of\\ntime-persistent trading opportunities. For rising inﬂation announcements,\\nthere are ﬁve 15-second periods during which USD/CAD consistently in-\\ncreased in response to the inﬂation announcement between 8:30 and\\n9:00A.M., presenting ready tradable opportunities.

The returns corresponding to the times of interest surrounding the\\nannouncements are calculated for the securities under consideration.\\nFor example, if the researcher is interested in evaluating the impact of\\nCPI announcements on the 5-minute change in USD/CAD, the 5-minute\\nchange in USD/CAD is calculated from 8:30A.M.t o8 : 3 5A.M. on histori-\\ncal data on past CPI announcement days. (The 8:30 to 8:35A.M. interval\\nis chosen for the 5-minute effect of CPI announcements, because the\\nU.S. CPI announcements are always released at 8:30A.M. ET.)\\n3. The impact of the announcements is then estimated in a simple linear\\nregression:\\nRt = α + β/Delta1Xt + εt\\nwhere Rt is the vector of returns surrounding the announcement for\\nthe security of interest arranged in the order of announcements; /Delta1Xt\\nis the vector of “surprise” changes in the announcements arranged in\\nthe order of announcements; εt is the idiosyncratic error pertaining to\\nnews announcements; α is the estimated intercept of the regression\\nthat captures changes in returns due to factors other than announce-\\nment surprises; and, ﬁnally,β measures the average impact of the an-\\nnouncement on the security under consideration.\\nChanges in equity prices are adjusted by changes in the overall market\\nprices to account for the impact of broader market inﬂuences on equity val-\\nues.

The evidence includes the ﬁndings of Navissi,\\nBowman, and Emanuel (1999), who ascertained that announcements of re-\\nlaxation or elimination of price controls resulted in an upswing in equity\\nvalues and that the introduction of price controls depressed equity prices.\\nBoscaljon (2005) found that the relaxation of advertising rules by the U.S.\\nFood and Drug Administration was accompanied by rising equity values.\\nMacroeconomic News\\nMacroeconomic decisions and some observations are made by government\\nagencies on a predetermined schedule. Interest rates, for example, are set\\nby economists at the central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve or\\nthe Bank of England.

How does the macroeconomic news impact equity\\nmarkets?\\nAccording to classical ﬁnancial theory, changes in equity prices are due\\nto two factors: changes in expected earnings of publicly traded ﬁrms, and\\nchanges in the discount rates associated with those ﬁrms. Expected earn-\\nings may be affected by changes in market conditions. For example, in-\\ncreasing consumer conﬁdence and consumer spending are likely to boost\\nretail sales, uplifting earnings prospects for retail outﬁts. Rising labor costs,\\non the other hand, may signal tough business conditions and decrease earn-\\nings expectations as a result.\\nThe discount rate in classical ﬁnance is, at its bare minimum, deter-\\nmined by the level of the risk-free rate and the idiosyncratic riskiness of a\\nparticular equity share. The risk-free rate pertinent to U.S. equities is often\\nproxied by the 3-month bill issued by the U.S. Treasury; the risk-free rate\\nsigniﬁcant to equities in another country is taken as the short-term target\\ninterest rate announced by that country’s central bank. The lower the risk-\\nfree rate, the lower the discount rate of equity earnings and the higher the\\ntheoretical prices of equities.\\nHow does macroeconomic news affect equities in practice? Ample\\nempirical evidence shows that equity prices respond strongly to interest\\nrate announcements and, in a less pronounced manner, to other macroe-\\nconomic news. Decreases in both long-term and short-term interest rates\\nindeed positively affect monthly stock returns with 90 percent statistical\\nconﬁdence for long-term rates and 99 percent conﬁdence for short-term\\nrates. Cutler, Poterba, and Summers (1989) analyzed monthly NYSE stock\\nreturns and found that, speciﬁcally, for every 1 percent decrease in the\\nyield on 3-month Treasury bills, monthly equity returns on the NYSE in-\\ncreased by 1.23 percent on average in the 1946–1985 sample.\\nStock reaction to nonmonetary macroeconomic news is usually mixed.\\nPositive inﬂation shocks tend to induce lower stock returns independent\\nof other market conditions (see Pearce and Roley, 1983, 1985 for details).\\nSeveral other macroeconomic variables produce reactions conditional on\\nthe contemporary state of the business cycle. Higher-than-expected indus-\\ntrial production ﬁgures are good news for the stock market during reces-\\nsions but bad news during periods of high economic activity, according to\\nMcQueen and Roley (1993).\\nSimilarly, unexpected changes in unemployment statistics were found\\nto cause reactions dependent on the state of the economy. For example,\\nOrphanides (1992) ﬁnds that returns increase when unemployment rises,\\nbut only during economic expansions. During economic contractions, re-\\nturns drop following news of rising unemployment.

The ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by Boyd,\\nHu, and Jagannathan (2005). The asymmetric response to macroeconomic\\nnews is not limited to the U.S. markets. L¨oﬂund and Nummelin (1997),\\nfor instance, observe the asymmetric response to surprises in industrial\\nproduction ﬁgures in the Finnish equity market; they found that higher-\\nthan-expected production growth bolsters stocks in sluggish states of the\\neconomy.\\nWhether or not macroeconomic announcements move stock prices,\\nthe announcements are usually surrounded by increases in market volatil-\\nity. While Schwert (1989) pointed out that stock market volatility is not\\nnecessarily related to volatility of other macroeconomic factors, surprises\\nin macroeconomic news have been shown to signiﬁcantly increase mar-\\nket volatility. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), for example, show that an\\nunexpected component in the interest rate announcements of the U.S.\\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increase equity return volatil-\\nity. Connolly and Stivers (2005) document spikes in the volatility of eq-\\nuities constituting the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in response\\nto U.S. macroeconomic news. Higher volatility implies higher risk, and ﬁ-\\nnancial theory tells us that higher risk should be accompanied by higher\\nreturns. Indeed, Savor and Wilson (2008) show that equity returns on days\\nwith major U.S. macroeconomic news announcements are higher than on\\ndays when no major announcements are made. Savor and Wilson (2008)\\nconsider news announcements to be “major” if they are announcements\\nof Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), employment\\nﬁgures, or interest rate decisions of the FOMC. Veronesi (1999) shows\\nthat investors are more sensitive to macroeconomic news during periods\\nof higher uncertainty, which drives asset price volatility. In the European\\nmarkets, Errunza and Hogan (1998) found that monetary and real macroe-\\nconomic news has considerable impact on the volatility of the largest\\nEuropean stock markets.\\nDifferent sources of information appear to affect equities at differ-\\nent frequencies. The macroeconomic impact on equity data appears to in-\\ncrease with the increase in frequency of equity data. Chan, Karceski, and\\nLakonishok (1998), for example, analyzed monthly returns for U.S. and\\nJapanese equities in an arbitrage pricing theory setting and found that\\nidiosyncratic characteristics of individual equities are most predictive of\\nfuture returns at low frequencies. By using factor-mimicking portfolios,\\nChan, Karceski, and Lakonishok (1998) show that size, past return, book-\\nto-market ratio, and dividend yield of individual equities are the factors that\\nmove in tandem (“covary”) most with returns of corresponding equities.\\nHowever, Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok (1998, p. 182) document that', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f45698fe-b1f8-4e10-b8d2-e77add3bbedc', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '195', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc12 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 20:5 Printer: Yet to come\\nEvent Arbitrage 181\\n“the macroeconomic factors do a poor job in explaining return covariation”\\nat monthly return frequencies. Wasserfallen (1989) ﬁnds no impact of\\nmacroeconomic news on quarterly equities data.\\nFlannery and Protopapadakis (2002) found that daily returns on the\\nU.S. equities are signiﬁcantly impacted by several types of macroeconomic\\nnews. The authors estimate a GARCH return model with independent vari-\\nables and found that the following macroeconomic announcements have\\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence on both equity returns and volatility: consumer price\\nindex (CPI), producer price index (PPI), monetary aggregate, balance of\\ntrade, employment report, and housing starts ﬁgures.\\nAjayi and Mehdian (1995) document that foreign stock markets in\\ndeveloped countries typically overreact to the macroeconomic news an-\\nnouncements from the United States. As a result, foreign equity markets\\ntend to be sensitive to the USD-based exchange rates and domestic account\\nbalances. Sadeghi (1992), for example, notes that in the Australian markets,\\nequity returns increased in response to increases in the current account\\ndeﬁcit, the AUD/USD exchange rate, and the real GDP; equity returns de-\\ncreased following news of rising domestic inﬂation or interest rates.\\nStocks of companies from different industries have been shown to re-\\nact differently to macroeconomic announcements. Hardouvelis (1987), for\\nexample, pointed out that stocks of ﬁnancial institutions exhibited higher\\nsensitivity to announcements of monetary adjustments. The extent of mar-\\nket capitalization appears to matter as well. Li and Hu (1998) show that\\nstocks with large market capitalization are more sensitive to macroeco-\\nnomic surprises than are small-cap stocks.\\nThe size of the surprise component of the macroeconomic news im-\\npacts equity prices. Aggarwal and Schirm (1992), for example, document\\nthat small surprises, those within one standard deviation of the average,\\ncaused larger changes in equities and foreign exchange markets than did\\nlarge surprises.\\nFixed-Income Markets\\nJones, Lamont, and Lumsdaine (1998) studied the effect of employment\\nand producer price index data on U.S. Treasury bonds. The authors ﬁnd\\nthat while the volatility of the bond prices increased markedly on the days\\nof the announcements, the volatility did not persist beyond the announce-\\nment day, indicating that the announcement information is incorporated\\npromptly into prices.\\nHardouvelis (1987) and Edison (1996) note that employment ﬁgures,\\nproducer price index (PPI), and consumer price index (CPI) move bond\\nprices.

Fleming and Remolona (1999) estimate the\\nhigh-frequency impact of macroeconomic announcements on the entire\\nU.S. Treasury yield curve. Fleming and Remolona (1999) measure the im-\\npact of 10 distinct announcement classes: consumer price index (CPI),\\ndurable goods orders, gross domestic product (GDP), housing starts, job-\\nless rate, leading indicators, non-farm payrolls, producer price index (PPI),\\nretail sales, and trade balance.

News-\\nrelated volatility, however, may often persist for the following 15 minutes.\\nEmerging Economies\\nSeveral authors have considered the impact of macroeconomic news on\\nemerging economies. For example, Andritzky, Bannister, and Tamirisa\\n(2007) study how macroeconomic announcements affect bond spreads.\\nThe authors found that the U.S. news had a major impact, whereas do-\\nmestic announcements did not generate much effect. On the other hand,\\nNikkinen, Omran, Sahlstr¨om, and ¨Aij ¨o (2006) conducted similar analysis\\non equity markets and found that while mature equity markets respond\\nalmost instantaneously to U.S. macroeconomic announcements, emerging\\nequity markets are not affected. Kandir (2008) estimated macroeconomic\\nimpact on monthly returns of equities trading on the Istambul Stock Ex-\\nchange, and found that the Turkish Lira/USD exchange rate, the Turkish\\ninterest rate, and the world market returns signiﬁcantly affect Turkish eq-\\nuities, while domestic variables such as industrial production and money\\nsupply had little effect. Muradoglu, Taskin, and Bigan (2000) found that\\nemerging markets were inﬂuenced by global macroeconomic variables, de-\\npending on the size of the emerging market under consideration and the\\ndegree of the market’s integration with the world economy.\\nASEAN countries, however, appear to be inﬂuenced predominantly by\\ntheir domestic variables. Wongbangpo and Sharma (2002) ﬁnd that local\\nGNPs, CPIs, money supplies, interest rates, and the USD-based exchange\\nrates of ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and\\nThailand) signiﬁcantly inﬂuence local stock markets.

The effect of the news announce-\\nments, however, can be mixed; higher-than-expected real activity and in-\\nﬂation generally have a positive effect on commodity prices, except when\\naccompanied by rising interest rates, which have a cooling impact on com-\\nmodity valuations. See Bond (1984), Chambers (1985), and Frankel (2006)\\nfor more details on the relation between commodity prices and interest\\nrates.\\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITS)\\nEquity real estate investment trusts (REITs) are fairly novel publicly traded\\nsecurities, established by the U.S. Congress in 1960. The market capitaliza-\\ntion of all U.S.-based REITs was about $9 million in 1991 and steadily grew\\nto $300 billion by 2006. A REIT is traded like an ordinary equity, but it\\nis required to have the following peculiar structure: at least 75 percent of\\nthe REIT’s assets should be invested in real estate, and the REIT must pay\\nout at least 90 percent of its taxable earnings as dividends. Because of their\\nhigh payout ratios, REITs may respond differently to macroeconomic news\\nannouncements than would ordinary equities.\\nThe impact of inﬂation on REIT performance has been documented by\\nSimpson, Ramchander, and Webb (2007). The authors found that the re-\\nturns on REITs increase when inﬂation unexpectedly falls as well as when\\ninﬂation unexpectedly rises. Bredin, O’Reilly, and Stevenson (2007) exam-\\nine the response of REIT returns to unanticipated changes in U.S. monetary\\npolicy. The authors ﬁnd that the response of REITs is comparable to that\\nof equities—increase in the Federal Funds rates increases the volatility of\\nREIT prices while depressing the REIT prices themselves.\\nCONCLUSION\\nEvent arbitrage strategies utilize high-frequency trading since price equi-\\nlibrium is reached only after market participants have reacted to the\\nnews.

Since then,\\nstatistical arbitrage has been both hailed and derided. The advanced re-\\nturns generated before 2007 by many stat-arb shops popularized the tech-\\nnique. Yet some blame stat-arb traders for destabilizing the markets in the\\n2007 and 2008 crises. Stat-arb can lead to a boon in competent hands and a\\nbust in semi-proﬁcient applications.\\nThe technique is a modern cousin of a technical analysis strategy utiliz-\\ning “Bollinger Bands” that was used to indicate maximum highs and lows\\nat any given point in time by plotting a two-standard deviation envelope\\naround the simple moving average of the price. Despite the recent explo-\\nsive popularity of stat-arb strategies, many misconceptions about the tech-\\nnique are prevalent. This chapter examines the stat-arb technique in detail.\\nAt its core, stat-arb rests squarely on data mining. To begin with, stat-\\narb analysts sift through volumes of historical data with the objective of\\nidentifying a pervasive statistical relationship. Such a relationship may be\\nbetween the current price level of the security and the price level of the\\nsame security in the recent past. The relationship may also be between\\nprice levels of two different securities, or the price level of one security\\nand the volatility of another. The critical point in the identiﬁcation process\\nis that the relationship has to hold with at least 90 percent statistical con-\\nﬁdence, 90 percent being the lowest acceptable conﬁdence threshold in\\nmost statistical analyses.\\n185', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='43458963-86c4-44eb-adee-9fed312e4e55', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '200', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc13 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:55 Printer: Yet to come\\n186 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nOnce a statistically signiﬁcant relationship is detected, a stat-arb trad-\\ning model is built around the following assumption: if at any point in time\\nthe statistical relationship is violated, the relationship will mean-revert to\\nits natural historical level and the trade should be placed in the mean-\\nreverting direction. The tendency to mean-revert is assumed to increase\\nwhenever the relationship is violated to a large extent.\\nThe degree of violation of the historical relationship can be measured\\nby the number of standard deviations the relationship has moved away\\nfrom the historical mean of values characterizing the relationship. For ex-\\nample, if the variable of interest is price and the price level of USD/CAD\\nrises by two or more standard deviations above its average historical price\\ndifference with the level of USD/CHF in a short period of time, the stat-\\narb strategy assumes that the unusually large move of USD/CAD is likely\\nto reverse in the near future, and the trading strategy enters into a short\\nposition in USD/CAD. If the mean-reversion indeed materializes, the strat-\\negy captures a gain. Otherwise, a stop loss is triggered, and the strategy\\nbooks a loss.\\nMATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS\\nMathematically, the steps involved in the development of stat-arb trad-\\ning signals are based on a relationship between price levels or other vari-\\nables characterizing any two securities. A relationship based on price levels\\nSi,t and Sj,t for any two securities i and j can be can be arrived at through\\nthe following procedure:\\n1. Identify the universe of liquid securities—that is, securities that trade\\nat least once within the desired trading frequency unit. For example,\\nfor hourly trading frequency choose securities that trade at least once\\nevery hour.\\n2. Measure the difference between prices of every two securities, i and j,\\nidentiﬁed in step (1) across time t:\\n/Delta1Sij,t = Si,t − Sj,t, t ∈ [1, T] (13.1)\\nwhere T is a sufﬁciently large number of daily observations. Accord-\\ning to the central limit theorem (CLT) of statistics, 30 observations at\\nselected trading frequency constitute the bare minimum. The intra-day\\ndata, however, has high seasonality—that is, persistent relationships\\ncan be observed at speciﬁc hours of the day. Thus, a largerT of at least\\n30 daily observations is strongly recommended.

Yet other statistical relationships,\\nthose validated by academic research in economics and ﬁnance, have con-\\nsistently produced positive results for many traders. Thorough understand-\\ning of economic theory helps quantitative analysts distinguish between\\nsolid and arbitrary relationships and, in turn, improves the proﬁtability of\\ntrading operations that use stat-arb methodology.\\nIn addition to the issues embedded in the estimation of statistical\\nrelationships, statistical arbitrage strategies are inﬂuenced by numerous\\nadverse market conditions.\\nr The strategies face a positive probability of bankruptcy of the parties\\nissuing one or both of the selected ﬁnancial instruments. Tough market\\nconditions, an unexpected change in regulation, or terrorist events can\\ndestroy credible public companies overnight.\\nr Transaction costs may wipe out all the proﬁtability of stat-arb trading,\\nparticularly for investors deploying high leverage or limited capital.\\nr The bid-ask spread may be wide enough to cancel any gains obtained\\nfrom the strategy.\\nr Finally, the pair’s performance may be determined by the sizes of the\\nchosen stocks along with other market frictions—for example, price\\njumps in response to earnings announcements.\\nCareful measurement and management of risks, however, can deliver\\nhigh stat-arb proﬁtability.

A classic example of\\na spurious relationship is the relationship between time as a continuous\\nvariable and the return of a particular stock; all publicly listed ﬁrms are\\nexpected to grow with time, and while the relationship produces a highly\\nsigniﬁcant statistical dependency, it can hardly be used to make meaningful\\npredictions about future values of equities. Another extreme example of a\\npotentially spurious statistical relationship is shown by Challe (2003), who\\ndocuments statistical signiﬁcance between the occurrence of sunspots and\\nthe predictability of asset returns.\\nHigh-frequency statistical arbitrage based on economic models has\\nex-ante longer staying power, because it is based on solid economic princi-\\nples. The stat-arb strategies arbitraging deviations in economic equations\\ncan be called fundamental arbitrage models in that they exploit deviations\\nfrom fundamental economic principles.\\nThe prices of the pair of securities traded often will be related in some\\nfashion or other, but they can nevertheless span a variety of asset classes\\nand individual names. In equities, the companies issuing securities may be-\\nlong to the same industry and will therefore respond similarly to changes\\nin the broad market. Alternatively, the securities may actually be issued by\\nthe same company. Companies often issue more than one class of shares,\\nand the shares typically differ by voting rights. Even shares of the same\\nclass issued by the same company but trading on different exchanges may\\nhave proﬁtable intra-day deviations in prices. In foreign exchange, the pair\\nof securities chosen can be a foreign exchange rate and a derivative (e.g.,\\na futures contract) on the same foreign exchange rate. The same underly-\\ning derivative trading strategy may well apply to equities and ﬁxed-income\\nsecurities. Passive indexes, such as infrequently rebalanced ETFs, can be\\npart of proﬁtable trades when the index and its constituents exhibit tem-\\nporary price deviations from equilibrium. In options, the pair of securities\\nmay be two options on the same underlying asset but with different times\\nto expiration.\\nThis section discusses numerous examples of statistical arbitrage ap-\\nplied to various securities.

Nenova (2003) shows that the stock\\nprice premium for voting privileges exists in most countries. The premium\\nvaries substantially from country to country and depends on the legal en-\\nvironment, the degree of investor protection, and takeover regulations,\\namong other factors. In countries with the greatest transparency, such as\\nFinland, the voting premium is worth close to 0, whereas in South Korea,\\nthe voting premium can be worth close to 50 percent of the voting stock’s\\nmarket value.\\nStocks with a higher number of shares outstanding are usually more\\nliquid, prompting actively trading investors to value them more highly;\\nsee Amihud and Mendelson (1986, 1989); Amihud (2002); Brennan and\\nSubrahmanyam (1996); Brennan, Chordia and Subrahmanyam (1998); and\\nEleswarapu (1997). At the same time, the more liquid class of shares is\\nlikely to incorporate market information signiﬁcantly faster than the less\\nliquid share class, creating the potential for information arbitrage.\\nA typical trade may work as follows: if the price range widens to more\\nthan two standard deviations of the average daily range without a sufﬁ-\\nciently good reason, it may be a fair bet that the range will narrow within\\nthe following few hours.\\nThe dual-class share strategy suffers from two main shortcomings and\\nmay not work for funds with substantial assets under management (AUM).\\n1. The number of public companies that have dual share classes trading in\\nthe open markets is severely limited, restricting the applicability of the\\nstrategy. In January 2009, for example, Yahoo! Finance carried histor-\\nical data for two equity classes for just eight companies trading on the\\nNYSE: Blockbuster, Inc.; Chipotle; Forest City Entertainment; Greif,\\nInc.; John Wiley & Sons; K V Pharma; Lennar Corp.; and Moog, Inc.\\n2. The daily volume for the less liquid share class is often small, further\\nrestricting the capacity of the strategy. Table 13.2 shows the closing\\nprice and daily volume for dual-class shares registered on the NYSE on\\nJanuary 6, 2009.

The degree of the co-movement that\\na particular security may experience with the market is different for each\\nindividual security and can vary through time. For example, stocks of lux-\\nury companies have been shown to produce positive returns whenever the\\nbroad market produces positive returns as well, whereas breweries and\\nmovie companies tend to produce higher positive returns whenever the\\noverall market returns are downward sloping.\\nThe CAPM equation is speciﬁed as follows:\\nri,t − rf,t = αi + βi(rM,t − rf,t) + εt (13.8)\\nwhere ri,t is the return on security i at time t, rM,t i st h er e t u r no nab r o a d\\nmarket index achieved in time period t, and rf,t is the risk-free interest\\nrate, such as Fed Funds rate, valid in time period t. The equation can be\\nestimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The resulting\\nparameter estimates, ˆα and ˆβ, measure the abnormal return that is intrinsic\\nto the security ( ˆα) and the security’s co-movement with the market (ˆβ).\\nThe simplest example of CAPM-based pair arbitrage in equities is trad-\\ning pairs with the same response to the changes in the broader market\\nconditions, or beta, but different intrinsic returns, or alpha. This type of\\nstrategy is often referred to as a market-neutral strategy, with the idea that\\ngoing long and short, respectively, in two securities with similar beta would\\nneutralize the resulting portfolio from broad market exposure.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='30138a01-b335-4d58-91c3-65d1fa47d0fc', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '208', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc13 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:55 Printer: Yet to come\\n194 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nOften, the two securities used belong to the same or a similar indus-\\ntry, although this is not mandatory. The alpha and beta for two securities\\ni and j are determined from the CAPM equation (13.8). Once the point esti-\\nmates for alphas and betas of the two securities are produced, along with\\nstandard deviations of those point estimates, the statistical signiﬁcance of\\ndifference in alphas and betas is then determined using the difference in\\nthe means test, described here for betas only:\\n/Delta1ˆβ = ˆβi − ˆβj (13.9)\\nˆσ/Delta1β=\\n√\\nσ2\\nβi\\nni\\n+\\nσ2\\nβj\\nnj\\n(13.10)\\nwhere ni and nj are the numbers of observations used in the estimation of\\nequation (13.8) for security i and security j, respectively.\\nThe standard t-ratio statistic is then determined as follows:\\nStudentβ = /Delta1ˆβ\\nˆσ/Delta1β\\n(13.11)\\nThe difference test for alphas follows the same procedure as the one out-\\nlined for betas in equations (13.9)–(13.11).\\nAs with other t-test estimations, betas can be deemed to be statistically\\ns i m i l a ri ft h et statistic falls within one standard deviation interval:\\ntβ ∈ [/Delta1ˆβ − ˆσ/Delta1β,/Delta1ˆβ + ˆσ/Delta1β] (13.12)\\nAt the same time, the difference in alphas has to be both economically\\nand statistically signiﬁcant. The difference in alphas has to exceed trading\\ncosts, TC, and the t-ratio has to indicate a solid statistical signiﬁcance, with\\n95 percent typically considered the minimum:\\n/Delta1ˆα> TC (13.13)\\n|tα| > [/Delta1ˆα + 2ˆσ/Delta1α] (13.14)\\nOnce a pair of securities satisfying equations (13.12)–(13.14) is identiﬁed,\\nthe trader goes long in the security with the higher alpha and shorts the\\nsecurity with the lower alpha.

For example, Fama and French (1993) show that the follow-\\ning three-factor model can be successfully used in equity pair trading:\\nri,t = αi + βMKT\\ni MKTt + βSMB\\ni SMBt + βHML\\ni HMLt + εt (13.15)\\nwhere ri,t is the return on stock i at time t, MKTt is the time-t return on\\na broad market index, SMBt (small minus big) is the time-t difference in\\nreturns between market indices or portfolios of small and big capitalization\\nstocks, and HMLt (high minus low) is the return on a portfolio constructed\\nby going long in stocks with comparatively high book-to-market ratios and\\ngoing short in stocks with comparatively low book-to-market ratios.\\nLiquidity Arbitrage In classical asset pricing literature, a ﬁnancial se-\\ncurity that offers some inconvenience to the prospective investors should\\noffer higher returns to compensate investors for the inconvenience. Lim-\\nited liquidity is one such inconvenience; lower liquidity levels make it more\\ndifﬁcult for individual investors to unwind their positions, potentially lead-\\ning to costly outcomes. On the ﬂipside, if liquidity is indeed priced in asset\\nreturns, then periods of limited liquidity may offer nimble investors highly\\nproﬁtable trading opportunities.\\nIn fact, several studies have documented that less liquid stocks have\\nhigher average returns: see Amihud and Mendelson (1986); Brennan and\\nSubrahmanyam (1996); Brennan, Chordia, and Subrahmanyam (1998); and\\nDatar, Naik, and Radcliffe (1998). Trading the illiquid stocks based exclu-\\nsively on the information that they are illiquid, however, delivers no posi-\\ntive abnormal returns. The relatively high average returns simply compen-\\nsate prospective investors for the risks involved in holding these less liquid\\nsecurities.\\nP´astor and Stambaugh (2003), however, recognize that at least a por-\\ntion of the observed illiquidity of ﬁnancial securities may be attributed to\\nmarket-wide causes. If the market-wide liquidity is priced into individual\\nasset returns, then market illiquidity arbitrage strategies may well deliver\\nconsistent positive abnormal returns on the risk-adjusted basis.\\nP´astor and Stambaugh (2003) ﬁnd that in equities, stocks whose re-\\nturns have higher exposure to variability in the market-wide liquidity in-\\ndeed deliver higher returns than stocks that are insulated from the market-\\nwide liquidity. To measure sensitivity of stock i to market liquidity, P ´astor\\nand Stambaugh (2003) devise a metric γ that is estimated in the following\\nOLS speciﬁcation:\\nre\\ni,t+1 = θ + βri,t + γ sign(re\\ni,t) · vi,t + τt+1 (13.16)\\nwhere ri,t is the return on stock i at time t, vi,t is the dollar volume for\\nstock i at time t, and re\\ni,t is the return on stock i at time t in excess of the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='32eb7fa2-cd13-42df-a8fd-0ae33c2a44cd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '210', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc13 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:55 Printer: Yet to come\\n196 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nmarket return at time t: re\\ni,t = ri,t − rm,t. The sign of the excess return re\\ni,t\\nproxies for the direction of the order ﬂow at time t; when stock returns\\nare positive, it is reasonable to assume that the number of buy orders in\\nthe market outweighs the number of sell orders, and vice versa. The prior\\ntime-period returnri,t is included to capture the ﬁrst-order autocorrelation\\neffects shown to be persistent in the return time series of most ﬁnancial\\nsecurities.\\nLarge-to-Small Information Spillovers Equity shares and other se-\\ncurities with relatively limited market capitalization are considered to be\\n“small.” The precise cutoff for “smallness” varies from exchange to ex-\\nchange. On the NYSE in 2002, for example, “small” stocks were those with\\nmarket capitalization below $1 billion; stocks with market capitalization of\\n$1 billion to $10 billion were considered to be “medium,” and “large” stocks\\nwere those with market cap in excess of $10 billion.\\nSmall stocks are known to react to news signiﬁcantly more slowly than\\nlarge stocks. Lo and MacKinlay (1990), for example, found that returns on\\nsmaller stocks follow returns on large stocks. One interpretation of this\\nphenomenon is that large stocks are traded more actively and absorb in-\\nformation more efﬁciently than small stocks. Hvidkjaer (2006) further doc-\\numents “an extremely sluggish reaction” of small stocks to past returns of\\nlarge stocks and attributes this underreaction to the inefﬁcient behavior of\\nsmall investors.\\nA proposed reason for the delay in the response of small stocks is\\ntheir relative unattractiveness to institutional investors who are the pri-\\nmary source of the information that gets impounded into market prices.\\nThe small stocks are unattractive to institutional investors because of their\\nsize. A typical size of a portfolio of a mid-career institutional manager is\\n$200 million; if a portfolio manager decides to invest into small stocks, even\\na well-diversiﬁed share of an institutional portfolio will end up moving the\\nmarket for any small stock signiﬁcantly, cutting into proﬁtability and rais-\\ning the liquidity risk of the position. In addition, ownership of 5 percent or\\nmore of a particular U.S. stock must be reported to the SEC, further com-\\nplicating institutional investing in small stocks. As a result, small stocks\\nare traded mostly by small investors, many of whom use daily data and\\ntraditional “low-tech” technical analysis to make trading decisions.\\nThe market features of small stocks make the stocks illiquid and highly\\ninefﬁcient, enabling proﬁtable trading. Llorente, Michaely, Saar, and Wang\\n(2002) studied further informational content of trade volume and found\\nthat stocks of smaller ﬁrms and stocks with large bid-ask spreads exhibit\\nmomentum following high-volume periods. Stocks of large ﬁrms and ﬁrms\\nwith small bid-ask spread, however, exhibit no momentum and sometimes\\nexhibit reversals following high-volume time periods.

The derivative of choice is often a futures contract since\\nfutures prices are linear functions of the underlying asset:\\nFt = St exp[rt(T − t)]\\nwhere Ft is the price of a futures contract at time t, St is the price of the\\nunderlying asset (e.g., equity share, foreign exchange rate, or interest rate)\\nalso at timet, T is the time the futures contract expires, andrt is the interest\\nrate at time t. For foreign exchange futures, rt is the differential between\\ndomestic and foreign interest rates.\\nBasis Trading The statistical arbitrage between a futures contract and\\nthe underlying asset is known as “basis trading.” As with equity pairs trad-\\ning, the basis-trading process follows the following steps: estimation of the\\ndistribution of the contemporaneous price differences, ongoing monitoring\\nof the price differences, and acting upon those differences.\\nLyons (2001) documents results of a basis-trading strategy involving\\nsix currency pairs: DEM/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, FRF/USD,\\nand USD/CAD. The strategy bets that the difference between the spot and\\nfutures prices reverts to its mean or median values. The strategy works as\\nfollows: sell foreign currency futures whenever the futures price exceeds\\nthe spot price by a certain predetermined level or more, and buy foreign\\ncurrency futures whenever the futures price falls short of the spot price\\nby at least a prespeciﬁed difference. Lyons (2001) reports that when the\\npredetermined strategy trigger levels are computed as median basis values,\\nthe strategy obtains a Sharpe ratio of 0.4–0.5.\\nFutures/Equity Arbitrage In response to macroeconomic news an-\\nnouncements, futures markets have been shown to adjust more quickly\\nthan spot markets. Kawaller, Koch, and Koch (1993), for example, show\\nthat prices of the S&P 500 futures react to news faster than prices of the\\nS&P 500 index itself, in the Granger causality speciﬁcation. A similar ef-\\nfect was documented by Stoll and Whaley (1990): for returns measured in\\n5-minute intervals, both S&P 500 and money market index futures led stock\\nmarket returns by 5 to 10 minutes.\\nThe quicker adjustment of the futures markets relative to the equi-\\nties markets is likely due to the historical development of the futures and', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9aee4d13-ac86-4096-ba2f-93250940f289', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '212', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc13 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:55 Printer: Yet to come\\n198 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nequities markets. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the central clearing-\\nhouse for futures contracts in North America, rolled out a fully functional\\nelectronic trading platform during the early 1990s; most equity exchanges\\nstill relied on a hybrid clearing mechanism that involved both human\\ntraders and machines up to the year 2005. As a result, faster information-\\narbitraging strategies have been perfected for the futures market, while\\nsystematic equity strategies remain underdeveloped to this day. By the time\\nthis book was written, the lead-lag effect between futures and spot mar-\\nkets had decreased from the 5- to 10-minute period documented by Stoll\\nand Whaley (1990) to a 1- to 2-second advantage. However, proﬁt-taking\\nopportunities still exist for powerful high-frequency trading systems with\\nlow transaction costs.\\nIndexes and ETFs\\nIndex arbitrage is driven by the relative mispricings of indexes and their\\nunderlying components. Under the Law of One Price, index price should\\nbe equal to the price of a portfolio of individual securities composing the\\nindex, weighted according to their weights within the index. Occasion-\\nally, relative prices of the index and the underlying securities deviate from\\nthe Law of One Price and present the following arbitrage opportunities.\\nIf the price of the index-mimicking portfolio net of transaction costs ex-\\nceeds the price of the index itself, also net of transaction costs, sell the\\nindex-mimicking portfolio, buy index, hold until the market corrects its in-\\ndex pricing, then realize gain. Similarly, if the price of the index-mimicking\\nportfolio is lower than that of the index itself, sell index, buy portfolio, and\\nclose the position when the gains have been realized.\\nAlexander (1999) shows that cointegration-based index arbitrage\\nstrategies deliver consistent positive returns and sets forth a cointegration-\\nbased portfolio management technique step by step:\\n1. A portfolio manager selects or is assigned a benchmark.

The discipline of portfolio optimization\\noriginated from the seminal work of Markowitz (1952). The two dimen-\\nsions of a portfolio that he reviewed are the average return and risk of\\nthe individual securities that compose the portfolio and of the portfolio\\nas a whole. Optimization is conducted by constructing an “efﬁcient fron-\\ntier,” a set of optimal risk-return portfolio combinations for the various in-\\nstruments under consideration. In the absence of leveraging opportunities\\n(opportunities to borrow and increase the total capital available as well as\\nopportunities to lend to facilitate leverage of others), the efﬁcient frontier\\nis constructed as follows:\\n1. For every possible combination of security allocations, the risk and\\nreturn are plotted on a two-dimensional chart, as shown in Figure 14.1.\\nDue to the quadratic nature of the risk function, the resulting chart\\ntakes the form of a hyperbola.\\nReturn\\nRisk\\nFIGURE 14.1 Graphical representation of the risk-return optimization con-\\nstructed in the absence of leveraging opportunities.

The points with the highest level of return for every given level of risk\\nare selected as the efﬁcient frontier. The same result is obtained if the\\nfrontier is selected as the set of points with the lowest level of risk for\\nevery given level of return. The bold segment highlights the efﬁcient\\nfrontier.\\n3. An individual investor then selects a portfolio on the efﬁcient frontier\\nthat corresponds to the investor’s risk appetite.\\nIn the presence of leveraging, the efﬁcient frontier shifts dramatically\\nupward to a straight line between the lending rate, approximated to be\\nrisk free for the purposes of high-level analysis, and the “market” portfo-\\nlio, which is a portfolio lying on a line tangent to the efﬁcient frontier of\\nFigure 14.2. Figure 14.2 shows the resulting efﬁcient frontier.\\nAn interpretation of the efﬁcient frontier in the presence of the lever-\\nage rate RF proceeds as follows. If an investor can lend a portion of his\\nwealth at the rate RF to high-grade borrowers, he can reduce the risk of\\nhis overall portfolio by reducing his risk exposure. The lending investor\\nthen ends up on the bold line betweenRF and the market portfolio point\\n(σM, RM). The investor incurs two advantages by lending compared with\\nselecting a portfolio from the efﬁcient set with no lending as represented\\nin Figure 14.1:\\n1.

With lending capabilities, the investor’s return gets scaled linearly to\\nhis scaling of risk. In the no-lending situation, the investor’s return de-\\ncreases faster than the investor’s decrease in risk.\\nSimilarly, an investor who decides to borrow to increase the capital of\\nhis portfolio ends up on the efﬁcient frontier but to the right of the market\\nportfolio. The borrowing investor, too, enjoys the return, which increases\\nlinearly with risk and is above the no-borrowing opportunity set.\\nCore Portfolio Optimization Framework\\nAnalytical estimation of the efﬁcient frontier requires an understanding of\\nthe returns delivered by the strategies making up the portfolio. The return\\nof each strategy i is measured as a simple average return over the time\\nperiod t ∈ [1,..., T],\\nRi = 1\\nT\\nT∑\\nt=1\\nRit (14.1)\\nwhere Rit is the return of strategy i in time period t, t ∈ [1,..., T]. The\\nannualized risk of each strategy i, σi2 is often measured as a variance Vi,a\\nsquare of the standard deviation:\\nVi = 1\\nT − 1\\nT∑\\nt=1\\n(Rit − Ri)2 (14.2)\\nNote that in computation of the average return, Ri, the sum of returns\\nis divided by the total number of returns,T, whereas in computation of the\\nrisk in equation (14.2), the sum of squared deviations from the mean is di-\\nvided by T − 1 instead. The T − 1 factor reﬂects the number of “degrees of\\nfreedom” used in the computation of Vi. Every statistical equation counts\\nevery independent variable (a raw number) as a degree of freedom; at the\\nsame time, every estimate used in the statistical equation reduces the num-\\nber of degrees of freedom by 1. Thus, in the estimation of Ri, the number\\nof independent variables is T, while in the estimation of Vi, the number of\\nindependent variables is reduced by 1 since the equation (14.2) uses Ri,a n\\nestimate itself.\\nThe sample frequency of time period t should match the frequency in-\\ntended for the analysis. In developing high-frequency trading frameworks,\\nit may be desirable to make all the inferences from returns at very high\\nintra-day frequencies—for example, a minute or a second.

The classic Markowitz (1952) method-\\nology takes the estimated parameters as true distributional values and\\nignores the estimation error. Frankfurter, Phillips, and Seagle (1971);\\nDickenson (1979); and Best and Grauer (1991), among others, point out\\nthat the estimation errors distort the portfolio selection process and result\\nin poor out-of-sample performance of the complete portfolio.\\nA common way to overcome estimation errors is to learn from them.\\nA mechanism known as the Bayesian approach proposes that the system\\nlearns from its own estimation mistakes by comparing its realized perfor-\\nmance with its forecasts. The portfolio optimization system then corrects\\nits future estimates based on its own learnings. In a purely systematic en-\\nvironment, the self-correction process happens without any human inter-\\nvention. The Bayesian self-correction mechanism is often referred to as a\\n“genetic algorithm.”\\nIn the Bayesian approach, the average return estimate of a particu-\\nlar security is considered to be a random variable and is viewed proba-\\nbilistically in the context of previously obtained information, or priors. All\\nexpectations are subsequently developed with respect to the distribution\\nobtained for the estimate. Multiple priors, potentially representing multi-\\nple investors or analysts, increase the accuracy of the distribution for the\\nestimate.\\nUnder the Bayesian speciﬁcation, all mean and variance-covariance es-\\ntimates are associated with a conﬁdence interval that measures the ac-\\ncuracy of the forecast. An accurate forecast has a tight conﬁdence inter-\\nval, while the inaccurate forecast has a wide conﬁdence interval. After\\nthe accuracy of the previous forecast has been determined, the portfolio\\nweight of a security is scaled depending on the width of the conﬁdence\\nintervals of these securities. The wider the conﬁdence intervals for param-\\neter estimates, the smaller the portfolio weight for that security. When the\\nconﬁdence intervals approach 0, the weights are similar to those of the\\nclassic mean-variance optimization.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='65ebda0a-0c2b-49df-8152-d7bcbe21a251', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '224', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc14 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:57 Printer: Yet to come\\n210 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nThe traditional Bayesian approach, applied to mean-variance optimiza-\\ntion by Jorion (1986), works as follows: both mean and variance estimates\\ncomputed on a contemporary data sample are adjusted by lessons gleaned\\nfrom historical (prior) observations.\\nThe dispersion of the distributions of the true mean and variance of\\nthe distributions shrink as more observations are collected and analyzed\\nwith time.

Both methodologies require that a sub-\\nstantial proportion of the portfolio at any time be left in cash or invested in\\nrisk-free bonds. Each methodology determines exactly what proportion of\\nthe portfolio should be left in cash and what proportion should be levered\\nand then invested into risky securities. The OBPI method is static in nature,\\nwhile the CPPI allocation changes with changes in the market value of the\\noverall portfolio.\\n1. The OBPI methodology suggests that only a ﬁxed proportion of the\\nportfolio (e.g.,X percent, X < 100 percent) be invested in risky instru-\\nments. The technique was ﬁrst developed by Leland and Rubenstein\\n(1976), who introduced the concept as options-based insurance. In\\nLeland and Rubenstein (1976), the portfolio is structured to preserve\\n(100− X) percent of the original portfolio capital, while allowing the\\nportfolio to beneﬁt from the potential upside of the X percent of the\\nportfolio invested in risky securities, such as options. Such portfolios\\nare now commonly securitized and marketed as “structured products.”\\nThe proportion of the portfolio X can be determined through the cost-\\nbeneﬁt analysis of option and bond prices versus expected probabili-\\nties of option payouts or, in high-frequency trading cases, the selling\\nprice of the option.\\n2. CPPI is another popular portfolio allocation strategy that calls for dy-\\nnamic adjustment of portfolio breakdown into cash and risky securi-\\nties, unlike OBPI, in which the breakdown is static. Black and Jones\\n(1987) and Perold and Sharpe (1988) created CPPI as an extension of\\nOBPI that morphed into an automated method widely used by industry\\npractitioners today.\\nCPPI works in accordance with the following steps:\\n1. Management sets the absolute worst-case maximum drawdown, a ﬂoor\\nfor the market value of the portfolio. If the market value of the portfolio\\nreaches the ﬂoor, the portfolio is fully liquidated into cash. Suppose\\nthat the maximum allowable drawdown is L percent.\\n2. The “cushion” is the difference between the market value of the port-\\nfolio and the ﬂoor. A proportion of the cushion is levered and invested\\nin risky securities. The exact proportion of the cushion invested in the\\nrisky instruments is determined by a “multiplier,”M, set by manage-\\nment. Common multipliers range from 3 to 6.\\n3. The risk capital allocated to the risky securities then becomes M ×\\nCu shion.

The value of the cushion at this point is $10 mil-\\nlion. If the multiplier is set to 5 (M= 5), the maximum actively invested\\nat-risk capital can be $50 million. However, this $50 million can be lev-\\nered. Black and Jones (1987) and Perold and Sharpe (1988) assumed\\nthat the leverage ratio on the cushion stays constant during the whole\\nlife of the portfolio, leading to the “constant” term in CPPI. Modern\\nCPPI strategies allow for dynamic leverage strategies that scale lever-\\nage down in adverse market conditions.\\nThe CPPI allocation ensures that the portfolio always has enough cash\\nto mitigate portfolio risks and to safeguard the investment principal. The\\nportfolio is periodically rebalanced to reﬂect the current market value of\\nthe portfolio. The higher the market value of the portfolio, the more of its\\nproportion is allocated to risky assets. Conversely, the lower the market\\nvalue of the portfolio, the higher the proportion of the portfolio that is held\\nin cash or in nearly risk-free ﬁxed-income securities.\\nWhat Proportion of the Portfolio Should Be\\nInvested into Which Trading Strategy?\\nAfter the performance of individual securities and trading strategies has\\nbeen assessed and the best performers identiﬁed, the composition of the\\nmaster portfolio is determined from the best-performing strategies. This\\nstep of the process is known as asset allocation and involves determining\\nthe relative weights of strategies within the master portfolio.\\nThe easiest approach to portfolio optimization is to create an equally\\nweighted portfolio of the best-performing strategies. Although the equally\\nweighted framework diversiﬁes the risk of the overall portfolio, it may not\\ndiversify the risk as well as a thorough portfolio optimization process. As\\nthe number of securities in the portfolio increases, however, determining\\nthe optimal weights for each security becomes increasingly complex and\\ntime-consuming—a real challenge in the high-frequency environment.\\nSeveral classes of algorithms have been proposed to simplify and\\nspeed up setting the optimal portfolio weights. Optimization algorithms fall\\ninto three classes:\\n1. The simultaneous equations framework is the algorithm that directly\\nfollows the Markowitz (1952) speciﬁcation. It has been shown to be\\ninefﬁcient for optimization if the portfolio exceeds 10 strategies, and it\\nmay produce highly erroneous forecasts when 20 or more assets are in-\\nvolved. The forecast errors are due to the estimation errors that occur\\nwhen the average returns and variances are computed.

Still, in addition to the\\nissues of forecast errors, the estimation time of this algorithm grows\\nexponentially with the number of trading strategies involved, making\\nthis method hardly suitable for high-frequency trading of many assets.\\n2. Nonlinear programming is a class of optimizers popular in commer-\\ncial software. The nonlinear algorithms employ a variety of techniques\\nwith the objective of maximizing or minimizing the target portfolio op-\\ntimization function given speciﬁed parameters such as portfolio allo-\\ncation weights. Some of these algorithms employ a gradient technique\\nwhereby they analyze the slope of the objective function at any given\\npoint and select the fastest increasing or decreasing path to the target\\nmaximum or minimum, respectively. The nonlinear programming algo-\\nrithms are equally sensitive to the estimation errors of the input means\\nand variances of the returns. Most often, the algorithms are too compu-\\ntationally complex to be feasible in the high-frequency environments.\\nA recent example of a nonlinear optimizer is provided by Steuer, Qi,\\nand Hirschberger (2006).\\n3. The critical line–optimizing algorithm was developed by Markowitz\\n(1959) to facilitate the computation of his own portfolio theory. The\\nalgorithm is fast and comparatively easy to implement. Instead of pro-\\nviding point weights for each individual security considered in the\\nportfolio allocation, the critical line optimizer delivers a set of port-\\nfolios on the efﬁcient frontier, a drawback that has precluded many\\ncommercial companies from adapting this method. A recent algorithm\\nby Markowitz and Todd (2000) addresses some of the issues. Accord-\\ning to Niedermayer and Niedermayer (2007), the Markowitz and Todd\\n(2000) algorithm outperforms the algorithm designed by Steuer, Qi,\\nand Hirschberger (2006) by a factor of 10,000 for at least 2,000 assets\\nconsidered simultaneously.\\nThe existing algorithms, whatever the complexity and accuracy of\\ntheir portfolio allocation outputs, may not be perfectly suited to the\\nhigh-frequency trading environment. First, in environments where a delay\\nof 1 second can result in a million-dollar loss, the optimization algorithms\\nin their current form still consume too much time and system power.\\nSecond, these algorithms ignore the liquidity considerations pertinent\\nto the contemporary trading settings; most of the transactions occur in\\nblocks or “clips” of a prespeciﬁed size. Trades of larger-than-normal sizes\\nas well as trades of smaller blocks incur higher transaction costs that in\\nthe high-frequency environment can put a serious strain on the system’s\\nproﬁtability.\\nA simple high-frequency alternative to the complex optimization so-\\nlutions is a discrete pair-wise (DPW) optimization developed by Aldridge', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e0a392bb-780f-4098-b6b0-4c94de7cec5f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '229', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc14 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 11:57 Printer: Yet to come\\nCreating and Managing Portfolios of High-Frequency Strategies 215\\n(2009c). The DPW algorithm is a fast compromise between the equally\\nweighted portfolio setting and a full-ﬂedged optimization machine that out-\\nputs portfolio weights in discrete clips of the prespeciﬁed sizes. No frac-\\ntional weights are allowed. The algorithm works as follows:\\n1. Candidates for selection into the overall portfolio are ranked using\\nSharpe ratios and sorted from the highest Sharpe ratio to the lowest.\\nThis step of the estimation utilizes the fact that the Sharpe ratio itself\\nis a measure of where each individual strategy lies on the efﬁcient\\nfrontier.\\n2. An even number of strategies with the highest Sharpe ratios are se-\\nlected for inclusion into the portfolio. Half of the selected strategies\\nshould have historically positive correlations with the market, and half\\nshould have historically negative correlations with the market.\\n3. After the universe of ﬁnancial instruments is selected on the basis of\\nthe Sharpe ratio characteristics, all selected strategies are ranked ac-\\ncording to their current liquidity. The current liquidity can be measured\\nas the number of quotes or trades that have been recorded over the\\npast 10 minutes of trading activity, for example.\\n4. After all the strategies have been ranked on the basis of their liquid-\\nity, the pairs are formed through the following process: the two strate-\\ngies within each pair have opposite historical correlation with the\\nmarket. Thus, strategies historically positively correlated with the mar-\\nket are matched with strategies historically negatively correlated with\\nthe market. Furthermore, the matching should occur according to\\nthe strategy liquidity rank. The most liquid strategy positively corre-\\nlated with the market should be matched with the most liquid strat-\\negy negatively correlated with the market, and so on until the least\\nliquid strategy positively correlated with the market is matched with\\nthe least liquid strategy negatively correlated with the market. The\\nliquidity-based matching ensures that the high-frequency dynamic cap-\\ntured by correlation is due to idiosyncratic movements of the strategy\\nrather than the illiquidity conditions of one strategy.\\n5. Next, for each pair of strategies, the high-frequency volatility of a port-\\nfolio of just the two strategies is computed for discrete position sizes\\nin either strategy. For example, in foreign exchange, where a stan-\\ndard transactional clip is $20 million, the discrete position sizes consid-\\nered for the pair-wise optimization may be−$60 million, −$40 million,\\n−$20 million, 0, $20 million, $40 million, and $60 million, where the mi-\\nnus sign indicates the short position.

The resulting pair portfolios are subsequently executed given the maxi-\\nmum allowable allocation constraints for each strategy. The maximum\\nlong and short allocation is predetermined and constrained as follows:\\nthe cumulative gross position in each strategy cannot exceed a cer-\\ntain size, and the cumulative net position cannot exceed another, sep-\\narately set, limit that is smaller than the aggregate of the gross limits\\nfor all strategies. The smaller net position clause ensures a degree of\\nmarket neutrality.\\nThe DWP algorithm is particularly well suited to high-frequency envi-\\nronments because it has the following properties:\\nr The DPW algorithm avoids the brunt of the impact of input estimation\\nerrors by reducing the number of strategies in each portfolio allocation\\ndecision.\\nr The negative historical correlation of input securities ensures that\\nwithin each pair of matched strategies, the minimum variance will re-\\nsult in long positions in both strategies most of the time. Long positions\\nin the strategies are shown to historically produce the highest returns\\nper unit of risk, as is determined during the Sharpe ratio ranking phase.\\nThe times that the system results in short positions for one or more\\nstrategy are likely due to idiosyncratic market events.\\nr The algorithm is very fast in comparison with other portfolio optimiza-\\ntion algorithms. The speed of the algorithm comes from the following\\n“savings” in computational time:\\nr If the total number of strategies selected in the Sharpe ratio ranking\\nphase is 2K, the DPW algorithm computes only K correlations. Most\\nother portfolio optimization algorithms compute correlation among\\nevery pair of strategies among the 2Ksecurities, requiring 2K(K − 1)\\ncorrelation computations instead.\\nr The grid search employed in seeking the optimal portfolio size for\\neach strategy within each portfolio pair optimizes only between two\\nstrategies, or in two dimensions. A standard algorithm requires a\\n2K-dimensional optimization.\\nr Finally, the grid search allows only a few discrete portfolio weight\\nvalues. In the main example presented here, there are seven\\nallowable portfolio weights:−$60 MM; −$40 MM; −$20 MM; 0;\\n$20 MM; $40 MM; and $60 MM.

The testing process is known as a back test. This chapter\\ndescribes the key considerations for a successful and meaningful\\nback test.\\nThe purpose of back tests is twofold. First, a back test validates the\\nperformance of the trading model on large volumes of historical data\\nbefore being used for trading live capital. Second, the back test shows\\nhow accurately the strategies capture available proﬁt opportunities and\\nwhether the strategies can be incrementally improved to capture higher\\nrevenues.\\nOptimally, the trading idea itself is developed on a small set of his-\\ntorical data. The performance from this sample is known as “in-sample”\\nperformance. One month of data can be perfectly sufﬁcient for in-sample\\nestimation, depending on the chosen strategy. To draw any statistically\\nsigniﬁcant inferences about the properties of the trading model at hand,\\nthe trading idea should be veriﬁed on large amounts of data that was not\\nused in developing the trading model itself. Having a large reserve of his-\\ntorical data (at least two years of continuous tick data) ensures that the\\nmodel minimizes the data-snooping bias, a condition that occurs when the\\nmodel overﬁts to a nonrecurring aberration in the data. Running the back\\ntest on a fresh set of historical data is known as making “out-of-sample”\\ninferences.\\nOnce the out-of-sample back-test results have been obtained, they\\nmust be evaluated.

Point forecasts predict that the price of a security will reach a\\ncertain level, or point. For example, a system that determines that the S&P\\n500 index will rise from the current 787 level to 800 within the following\\nweek is a point forecast system; the point forecast in this case is the 800\\nnumber predicted for the S&P 500. Directional systems make decisions\\nto enter into positions based on expectations of the system going up or\\ndown, without speciﬁc target forecasts. A directional system may predict\\nthat USD/CAD will rise from its current level without making a speciﬁc\\nprediction about how far USD/CAD will rise.\\nEVALUATING POINT FORECASTS\\nThe simplest way to evaluate the validity of point forecasts is to run a\\nregression of realized values from the historical data against the out-of-\\nsample forecasts. For example, suppose that the trading model predicts\\nfuture price levels of equities. Regressing the realized equity prices on the\\nforecasted ones shows the degree of usefulness of the forecast.\\nSpeciﬁcally, the model evaluation regression is speciﬁed as follows:\\nYt = α + βXt + εt (15.1)\\nwhere Y is the realized price level, X is the forecasted price level, α and β\\nare parameters estimated by the regression, and ε is a normally distributed\\nerror term. Whenever the forecast perfectly predicts the realized values,\\nβ= 1 and α = 0. The deviation of the α and β parameters from the opti-\\nmal β = 1 and α = 0 itself indicates the reliability and usefulness of the\\nforecasting model. In addition, the R2 coefﬁcient obtained from the regres-\\nsion shows the percentage of realized observations explained by the fore-\\ncasts. The higher the realizedR2, the greater the accuracy of the forecasting\\nmodel.\\nThe accuracy of point forecasts can also be evaluated by comparing\\nthe forecasts with the realized values.

An accuracy curve plots probabilistic hit rates of different\\nforecasting models versus the ideal (100 percent accurate) forecast.\\nThe trading strategy accuracy (TSA) curves plot the cumulative dis-\\ntribution of the “hits” of the trading models versus the “miss” signals.

The model with the TSA curve closest to the ideal curve is the best\\nmodel. A TSA curve is generated as follows:\\n1. Gather information on all trade outcomes and their ex-ante forecasts.\\nA winning trade can be identiﬁed as a “1,” while a losing trade can be\\nidentiﬁed as a “0.” Similarly, a hit ex-ante forecast that predicted a win\\nand resulted in a win can be identiﬁed as a “1,” and so can an ex-ante hit\\npredicting a loss and resulting in a loss. An ex-ante miss of either the\\nforecasted win resulting in a loss or a forecasted loss resulting in a win\\ncan be identiﬁed as “0.” Table 15.3 shows the resulting data structure\\nfor several sample trades.\\n2. Calculate the total number of hits, H, and misses, M, among all trade\\noutcomes. In our example, there were two hits and three misses.

When a version of the system appears to be complete,\\nnew issues demand advanced modiﬁcations and enhancements that lead to\\na new development cycle.\\nThe purpose of the planning phase is to determine the goals of the\\nproject as well as to generate a high-level view of what the completed\\nproject may look like. The planning is accompanied by a feasibility study\\nthat evaluates the project in terms of its economics, operating model, and\\ntechnical requirements. The economical considerations explore whether\\nthe project has a sufﬁcient proﬁt and loss (P&L) potential, whereas oper-\\national and technical issues address the feasibility of the project from the\\ncompliance, human resources, and other day-to-day points of view. The\\noutputs of the planning phase include concrete goals and targets set for\\nthe project, established schedules, and estimated budgets for the entire\\nsystem.\\nDuring the analysis stage of the process, the team aggregates require-\\nments for system functionality, determines the scope of the project (which\\nfeatures are in and which features are out of the current release), and so-\\nlicits initial feedback from users and management. The analysis stage is\\narguably the most critical stage in the development process, because it is\\nhere that stakeholders have the ultimate ability to shape the functionality\\nof the system given the allocated budget.\\nThe design phase incorporates detailed speciﬁcations of functionality,\\nincluding process diagrams, business rules, and screenshots, along with\\nother output formats such as those of daily reports and other documents.\\nAn objective of the design stage is to separate the whole project into dis-\\ncrete components subsequently assigned to teams of software developers;\\nthe discrete components will have well-speciﬁed interfaces that can lock\\nin seamlessly with other components designed by different teams of soft-\\nware developers. Such early speciﬁcation of software packaging of inter-\\nnal computer modules streamlines future communication among different\\nsoftware development teams and enables smooth operation of the project\\ngoing forward. The design phase also outlines test cases—that is, the func-\\ntionality paths that are later used as blueprints to verify the correctness of\\nthe completed code.\\nThe implementation phase, ﬁnally, involves actual programming; the\\nsoftware teams or individual programmers develop software modules ac-\\ncording to the speciﬁcations deﬁned in the design stage. The individual\\nmodules are then tested by the development teams themselves against the\\npredeﬁned test cases. When the project management is satisﬁed that the\\nindividual modules have been developed according to the speciﬁcations,\\nthe project integration work begins. Integration, as its name implies, refers\\nto putting together the individual modules to create a functional system.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='01ccc747-700f-4145-a5bf-79acf5af329b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '250', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc16 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:1 Printer: Yet to come\\n236 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nWhile successfully planned projects encounter little variance or prob-\\nlems in the integration stage, some work still remains. Scripts may have\\nto be written to ensure proper communication among various system\\ncomponents, installation wrappers may have to be developed, and, most\\nimportantly, the system has to be comprehensively tested to ensure proper\\noperation. The test process usually involves dedicated personnel other\\nthan the people who developed the code. The test staff diligently monitors\\nthe execution of each functionality according to testing procedures deﬁned\\nin the design stage. The test personnel then documents any “bugs”—that\\nis, discrepancies between the prespeciﬁed test case performance and ob-\\nserved performance. The bugs are then sent back over to the development\\nteam for resolution and are subsequently returned to the testing teams.\\nSuccessful implementation is followed by the deployment and subse-\\nquent maintenance phase of the system.

Accepts quotes and order acknowledgments\\n2. Uses the quotes as input to the core analysis engine\\n3. Outputs trading signals\\nThe core analysis engine is typically based on the historical analysis\\nidentiﬁed to generate consistent positive returns over a signiﬁcant period\\nof time during the simulation and back-testing process. The development\\nof the core engine usually proceeds as follows. First, a quantitative ana-\\nlyst identiﬁes a mispriced security, a market inefﬁciency, or a persistent\\ndeviation from equilibrium. This ﬁrst modeling step is often done using\\nthe MatLab or R programming languages, which are designed to facilitate\\nmathematical operations.\\nNext, the quantitative analyst, usually in conjunction with technical\\nspecialists, back-tests the model on several years of data. A back test of\\nseveral years (two at the very minimum) should produce a sample distribu-\\ntion of returns that is numerous enough to be close to the true distribution\\nof returns characterizing both past and future performance. If the model\\ndelivers consistently positive results in the back test over several years,\\nthe model is then programmed into its production state.\\nMost of the high-frequency production-bound systems are written in\\nC++, although some hedge funds and other investment management ﬁrms\\nare known to use Java. C++is often considered to be “lighter” and “faster”\\nthan Java, meaning that C++ programs do not have the processing power\\noverhead required by Java; as a result, C++systems often work faster than\\nJava-based systems. C++ programmers, however, must be careful in their\\nutilization of the system’s run-time memory, whereas Java is designed to\\ntake care of all run-time memory issues whether or not the programmer\\nremembers to do so.\\nThe design and implementation of run-time portfolio management\\nreﬂects the core econometric engine. In addition to the raw quote inputs,\\nthe portfolio management framework incorporates inputs from the econo-\\nmetric model, current position sizes, and other information relevant to\\nportfolio diversiﬁcation and maximization of portfolio returns, while mini-\\nmizing portfolio risk.\\nThe core engine and the portfolio management framework then initiate\\nand transmit orders to the broker-dealer. Upon receiving and executing an\\norder, the broker-dealer sends back the order status and order-ﬁlling price\\nand size to the client.

Accord-\\ning to the FIX industry website (http://www.ﬁxprotocol.org), FIX emerged\\nin 1992 as a bilateral communications framework for equity trading be-\\ntween Fidelity Investments and Salomon Brothers. It has since become\\nthe dominant communication method among various broker-dealers, ex-\\nchanges, and transacting customers. In fact, according to a survey con-\\nducted by ﬁxprotocol.org, FIX was used for systematic trading by 75 per-\\ncent of buy-side ﬁrms, 80 percent of sell-side ﬁrms, and over 75 percent of\\nexchanges in 2006.\\nFIX is best described as a programming language that is overseen by\\na global steering committee, consisting of representatives from banks,\\nbroker-dealers, exchanges, industry utilities and associations, institutional\\ninvestors, and information technology providers from around the world.\\nIts standard is open and free. Implementation of communication process\\nvia FIX, however, requires careful planning and dedicated resources and\\nmay demand signiﬁcant expense, much like any other system development\\nprocess.\\nA typical FIX message is composed of a header, a body, and a trailer.\\nThe header always contains the following three ﬁelds: a string identifying\\nthe beginning of a message (FIX ﬁeld # 8), the number of characters in the\\nbody of the message to follow the message header (FIX ﬁeld # 9), and\\nthe type of the message (FIX ﬁeld # 35). Among many message types are\\nquotation and order execution directives and acknowledgments as well as\\nhousekeeping messages designed to ensure that the system remains up and\\nrunning.\\nFor example, MsgType = 0 is the “Heartbeat” message—a message is\\nsent to the other communication party to ensure that the communication\\nconnection remains operational and has not been lost as a result of any\\nunforeseen technical problems. The heartbeat message is typically sent af-\\nter a prespeciﬁed number of seconds of inactivity. If either communication\\nparty has not received a heartbeat message from the other party, it sends\\na TestRequest message (MsgType = 1) to “poll” the other communication\\nparty. If no heartbeat message is received following a TestRequest mes-\\nsage, the connection is considered lost and steps are taken to restart it.\\nMsgType = 6 is known as “Indication of Interest.” Exchanges and\\nbroker-dealers use Indication of Interest messages to transmit their inter-\\nest in either buying or selling in either a proprietary or an agency capacity.\\nMsgType = R indicates a “Quote Request” message with which a client of\\na broker-dealer requests a quote stream.

Once coded for\\nproduction setup, the simulation engine is ﬁrst run on a long sample of\\nhistorical data in a process known as back-testing. At this point, the sim-\\nulation engine can be reﬁned to incorporate any system tweaks and bug\\nﬁxes. Once the back test performs satisfactorily, the system is switched to\\nrun on real-time data, the same data that feeds into the production system.\\nAt this point, however, the system is still in the testing phase and the sys-\\ntem’s ability to send production orders is disabled. Instead, all orders that\\nwould be sent to the broker-dealer are recorded in a text ﬁle.

Once the bounds are breached,\\nthe human trader should have the authority to shut down trading for the\\nday or until the conditions causing the breach have been resolved.\\nCommon Pitfalls in Systems Implementation\\nTime Distortion The simulation runs in its own time using quotes col-\\nlected and stored during a run-time of another process. The frequency of\\nthe quotes recorded by the process that collected the data that is now his-\\ntorical data can vary greatly, mostly because of the following two factors:\\n1. The number of ﬁnancial instruments for which the original process col-\\nlected quotes\\n2. The speed of the computer system on which the original process ran\\nTheir impact is due to the nature of the quote process and its realiza-\\ntion in most trading systems. Most systems comprise a client (the quote\\ncollecting and/or trading application) that is geared to receive quotes and\\nthe server (a broker-dealer application supplying the quotes). The client is\\nmost often a “local” application that runs “locally”: on computer hardware\\nover which the trader has full control. The broker-dealer server is almost\\nalways a remote application, meaning that the client has to communicate\\nwith the server over a remote connection, such as the Internet. To receive\\nquotes, the client application usually has to perform the following commu-\\nnication with the server process:\\n1. The client sends the server a message or a series of messages with the\\nfollowing information:\\na. Client identiﬁcation (given to the client by the broker-dealer that\\nhouses the server)\\nb. Names of ﬁnancial securities for which the quotes are requested\\n2. The server will respond, acknowledging the client’s message. The\\nserver’s response will also indicate whether the client is not allowed\\nto receive any of the quotes requested for any reason.\\n3. The server will begin to stream the quotes to the client. The quotes are\\ntypically streamed in an “asynchronous” manner—that is, the server\\nwill send a quote to the client as soon as a new quote becomes avail-\\nable. Some securities have higher-frequency quotes than others. For\\nexample, during high-volatility times surrounding economic announce-\\nments, it is not unusual for the EUR/USD exchange rate to be accom-\\npanied by as many as 30 quotes per second. At the same time, some\\nobscure stock may generate only one quote per trading day. It is impor-\\ntant to keep in mind the expected frequency of quotes while designing\\nthe quote-receiving part of the application.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='44b1b6cc-dcd9-46ef-8aaa-8adf1cd10f94', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '258', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc16 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:1 Printer: Yet to come\\n244 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\n4. Quote distortion often happens next. It is the responsibility of the\\nclient to collect and process all the quotes as soon as they arrive at\\nthe client’s computer. Here, several issues can occur. On the client’s\\nmachine, all incoming quotes are placed into a queue in the order of\\ntheir arrival, with the earliest quotes located closest to the processor.\\nThis queue can be thought of as a line for airport check-in. Unlike the\\nairport line, however, the queue often has a ﬁnite length or capacity;\\ntherefore, any quote arrivals that ﬁnd the queue full are discarded.\\nHence the ﬁrst issue: Quote time series may vary from client to client\\nif the client systems have queues of varying lengths, all other system\\ncharacteristics being equal.\\nOnce the quotes are in the queue, the system picks the earliest\\nquote arrival from the queue for processing; then all the quotes in the\\nqueue are shifted closer to the processing engine. As noted previously,\\nthe quotes may arrive faster than the client is able to process them, ﬁll-\\ning up the queue and leading the system to discard new quote arrivals\\nuntil the older quotes are processed. Even a seemingly simple opera-\\ntion such as copying a quote to a ﬁle or a database stored on the com-\\nputer system takes computer time. While the quote-storing time may\\nbe a tiny fraction of a second and thus negligible by human time stan-\\ndards, the time can be signiﬁcant by computer clock, and slow down\\nthe processing of incoming quotes.\\nA client system may assign the quote an arrival time on taking the\\nquote from its arrival queue. The timestamp may therefore differ from\\nthe timestamp given to the quote by the server. Depending on the num-\\nber of securities for which the quotes are collected and the market’s\\nvolatility at any given time of day, the timestamp distortion may dif-\\nfer signiﬁcantly as a result of the quote-processing delay alone. If the\\nquotes are further mathematically manipulated to generate trading sig-\\nnals, the distortions in timestamps may be even more considerable.\\n5. Naturally, systems running on computers with slower processing\\npower will encounter more timestamp distortion than systems running\\non faster machines. Faster machines are quicker at processing sequen-\\ntial quotes and drop fewer quotes as a result. Even the slightest differ-\\nences in system power can result in different quote streams that in turn\\nmay produce different trading signals.\\nThe reliability of quote delivery can be improved in the following four\\nways:\\n1.

Testing has the following stages:\\nr Data set testing\\nr Unit testing\\nr Integration testing\\nr System testing\\nr Regression testing\\nr Use case testing\\nData Set Testing\\nData set testing refers to testing the validity of the data, whether historical\\ndata used in a back test or real-time data obtained from a streaming data\\nprovider. The objective of data testing is to ascertain that the system mini-\\nmizes undesirable inﬂuences and distortions in the data and to ensure that\\nthe run-time analysis and trading signal generation work smoothly.\\nData set testing is built on the premise that all data received for\\na particular security should fall into a statistical distribution that is', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='10affb32-8c6d-4eab-b627-996e59c6a11b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '261', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc16 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:1 Printer: Yet to come\\nImplementing High-Frequency Trading Systems 247\\nconsistent throughout time. The data should also exhibit consistent distri-\\nbutional properties when sampled at different frequencies: 1-minute data\\nfor USD/CAD, for example, should be consistent with historical 1-minute\\ndata distribution for USD/CAD observed for the past year. Naturally, data\\nset testing should allow for distributions to change with time, but the ob-\\nserved changes should not be drastic, unless they are caused by a large-\\nscale market disruption.\\nA popular procedure for testing data is based on testing for consistency\\nof autocorrelations. It is implemented as follows:\\n1. A data set is sampled at a given frequency—say, 10-second intervals.\\n2. Autocorrelations are estimated for a moving window of 30 to 1,000\\nobservations.\\n3. The obtained autocorrelations are then mapped into a distribution;\\noutliers are identiﬁed, and their origin is examined. The distributional\\nproperties can be analyzed further to answer the following questions:\\nr Have the properties of the distribution changed during the past\\nmonth, quarter, or year?\\nr Are these changes due to the version of the code or to the addition\\nor removal of programs on the production box?\\nThe testing should be repeated at different sampling frequencies to en-\\nsure that no systemic deviations occur.\\nUnit Testing\\nUnit testing veriﬁes that each individual software component of the system\\nworks properly. A unit is a testable part of an application; the deﬁnition of a\\nunit can range from the code for the lowest function or method to the func-\\ntionality of a medium-level component—for example, a latency measure-\\nment component of the post-trade analysis engine. Testing code in small\\nblocks from the ground up ensures that any errors are caught early in the\\nintegration process, avoiding expensive system disruptions at later stages.\\nIntegration Testing\\nIntegration testing follows unit testing. As its name implies, integration\\ntesting is a test of the interoperability of code components; the test is\\nadministered to increasingly larger aggregates of code as the system is\\nbeing built up from modular pieces to its completed state. Testing modular\\ninteroperability once again ensures that any code defects are caught and\\nﬁxed early.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='aa1b783e-d26f-4a79-aa5b-c888b7757af8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '262', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc16 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:1 Printer: Yet to come\\n248 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nSystem Testing\\nSystem testing is a post-integration test of the system as a whole. The sys-\\ntem testing incorporates several testing processes described as follows.\\nGraphical user interface (GUI) software testing ensures that the hu-\\nman interface of the system enables the user (e.g., the person responsible\\nfor monitoring trading activity) to perform her tasks. GUI testing typically\\nensures that all the buttons and displays that appear on screen are con-\\nnected with the proper functionality according to the speciﬁcations devel-\\noped during the design phase of the development process.\\nUsability and performance testing is similar in nature to GUI testing but\\nis not limited to graphical user interfaces and may include such concerns\\nas the speed of a particular functionality. For example, how long does the\\nsystem take to process a “system shutdown” request? Is the timing accept-\\nable from a risk management perspective?\\nStress testing is a critical component of the testing of high-frequency\\ntrading systems. A stress-testing process attempts to document and, sub-\\nsequently, quantify the impact of extreme hypothetical scenarios on the\\nsystem’s performance. For example, how does the system react if the price\\nof a particular security drops 10 percent within a very short time? What\\nif an act of God occurs that shuts down the exchange, leaving the system\\nholding its positions? What other worst-case scenarios are there and how\\nwill they affect the performance of the system and the subsequent P&L?\\nSecurity testing is another indispensable component of the testing pro-\\ncess that is often overlooked by organizations. Security testing is designed\\nto identify possible security breaches and to either provide a software so-\\nlution for overcoming the breaches or create a breach-detection mecha-\\nnism and a contingency plan in the event a breach occurs. High-frequency\\ntrading systems can be vulnerable to security threats coming from the In-\\nternet, where unscrupulous users may attempt to hijack account numbers,\\npasswords, and other conﬁdential information in an attempt to steal trad-\\ning capital. However, intra-organizational threats should not be underes-\\ntimated; employees with malicious intent or disgruntled workers having\\nimproper access to the trading system can wreak considerable and costly\\nhavoc. All such possibilities must be tested and taken into account.\\nScalability testing refers to testing the capacity of the system. How\\nmany securities can the system proﬁtably process at the same time with-\\nout incurring signiﬁcant performance impact? The answer to this question\\nmay appear trivial, but the matter is anything but trivial in reality. Every in-\\ncremental security measure added to the system requires an allocation of\\ncomputer power and Internet bandwidth. A large number of securities pro-\\ncessed simultaneously on the same machine may considerably slow down\\nsystem performance, distorting quotes, trading signals, and the P&L as a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c6d378c1-c49b-4427-9d5c-54508b543de6', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '263', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc16 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:1 Printer: Yet to come\\nImplementing High-Frequency Trading Systems 249\\nresult. A determination of the maximum permissible number of securities\\nwill be based on the characteristics of each trading platform, including\\navailable computing power.\\nReliability testing determines the probable rate of failure of the sys-\\ntem. Reliability testing seeks to answer the following questions: What are\\nthe conditions under which the system fails? How often can we expect\\nthese conditions to occur? The failure conditions may include unexpected\\nsystem crashes, shutdowns due to insufﬁcient memory space, and anything\\nelse that leads the system to stop operating. The failure rate for any well-\\ndesigned high-frequency trading system should not exceed 0.01 percent\\n(i.e., the system should be guaranteed to remain operational 99.99 percent\\nof the time).\\nRecovery testing refers to veriﬁcation that in an adverse event, whether\\nan act of God or a system crash, the documented recovery process en-\\nsures that the system’s integrity is restored and it is operational within a\\nprespeciﬁed time. The recovery testing also ensures that data integrity is\\nmaintained through unexpected terminations of the system. Recovery test-\\ning should include the following scenarios: When the application is running\\nand the computer system is suddenly restarted, the application should have\\nvalid data upon restart. Similarly, the application should continue operat-\\ning normally if the network cable should be unexpectedly unplugged and\\nthen plugged back in.\\nUse Case Testing\\nThe term use case testing refers to the process of testing the system ac-\\ncording to the system performance guidelines deﬁned during the design\\nstage of the system development. In use case testing, a dedicated tester\\nfollows the steps of using the system and documents any discrepancies be-\\ntween the observed behavior and the behavior that is supposed to occur.\\nUse case testing ensures that the system is operating within its parameters.\\nCONCLUSION\\nImplementation of high-frequency systems is a critical process, one in\\nwhich mistakes can be very costly. Outsourcing noncritical components\\nof the system may be a prudent strategy.

Com-\\npetent and thorough risk management in a high-frequency setting is es-\\npecially important, given that large-scale losses can mount quickly at the\\nslightest shift in behavior of trading strategies. The losses may be due to a\\nwide range of events, such as unforeseen trading model shortcomings, mar-\\nket disruptions, acts of God (earthquakes, ﬁre, etc.), compliance breaches,\\nand similar adverse conditions.\\nDetermining organizational goals for risk management is hardly a triv-\\nial endeavor. To effectively manage risk, an organization ﬁrst needs to\\ncreate clear and effective processes for measuring risk. The risk man-\\nagement goals, therefore, should set concrete risk measurement method-\\nologies and quantitative benchmarks for risk tolerance associated with\\ndifferent trading strategies as well as with the organization as a whole. Ex-\\npressing the maximum allowable risk in numbers is difﬁcult, and obtaining\\norganization-wide agreement on the subject is even more challenging, but\\nthe process pays off over time through quick and efﬁcient daily decisions\\nand the resulting low risk.\\nA thorough goal-setting exercise should achieve senior management\\nconsensus with respect to the following questions:\\nr What are the sources of risk the organization faces?\\nr What is the extent of risk the organization is willing to undertake? What\\nrisk/reward ratio should the organization target? What is the minimum\\nacceptable risk/reward ratio?\\nr What procedures should be followed if the acceptable risk thresholds\\nare breached?\\nThe sources of risk should include the risk of trading losses, as well\\nas credit and counterparty risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal\\nrisk. The risk of trading losses, known as market risk, is the risk induced\\nby price movements of all market securities; credit and counterparty risk\\naddresses the ability and intent of trading counterparties to uphold their\\nobligations; liquidity risk measures the ability of the trading operation to\\nquickly unwind positions; operational risk enumerates possible ﬁnancial\\nlosses embedded in daily trading operations; and legal risk refers to all\\ntypes of contract frustration. A successful risk management practice iden-\\ntiﬁes risks pertaining to each of these risk categories.\\nEvery introductory ﬁnance textbook notes that higher returns, on aver-\\nage, are obtained with higher risk. Yet, while riskier returns are on average\\nhigher across the entire investing population, some operations with risky\\nexposures obtain high gains and others suffer severe losses.

Examples of the worst-\\ncase losses to be tolerated may be 10 percent of organizational equity per\\nmonth or a hard dollar amount—for example, $150 million per ﬁscal year.\\nOnce senior management has agreed to the goals of risk management,\\nit becomes necessary to translate the goals into risk processes and or-\\nganizational structures. Processes include development of a standardized\\napproach for review of individual trading strategies and the trading port-\\nfolio as a whole. Structures include a risk committee that meets regularly,\\nreviews trading performance, and discusses the ﬁrm’s potential exposure\\nto risks from new products and market developments.\\nThe procedures for dealing with breaches of established risk manage-\\nment parameters should clearly document step-by-step actions. Corporate\\nofﬁcers should be appointed as designated risk supervisors responsible\\nto follow risk procedures. The procedures should be written for dealing\\nwith situations not if, but when a risk breach occurs. Documented step-by-\\nstep action guidelines are critical; academic research has shown that the\\nbehavior of investment managers becomes even riskier when investment\\nmanagers are incurring losses. See, for example, Kahneman and Teversky\\n(1979), Kouwenberg and Ziemba (2007), and Carpenter (2000).

The Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology\\nis the most common statistical risk measurement tool, discussed in detail\\nin the sections that focus on market and liquidity risk estimation. Statis-\\ntical models are the preferred methodology of risk estimation whenever\\nstatistical modeling is feasible.\\nScalar models establish the maximum foreseeable loss levels as per-\\ncentages of business parameters, such as revenues, operating costs, and\\nthe like. The parameters can be computed as averages of several days,\\nweeks, months, or even years of a particular business variable, depend-\\ning on the time frame most suitable for each parameter. Scalar models are\\nfrequently used to estimate operational risk.\\nScenario analysis determines the base, best, and worst cases for the\\nkey risk indicators (KRIs). The values of KRIs for each scenario are deter-\\nmined as hard dollar quantities and are used to quantify all types of risk.\\nScenario analysis is often referred to as the “stress test.”\\nCausal modeling involves identiﬁcation of causes and effects of\\npotential losses. A dynamic simulation model incorporating relevant causal\\ndrivers is developed based on expert opinions. The simulation model can\\nthen be used to measure and manage credit and counterparty risk, as well\\nas operational and legal risks. The following sections discuss the measure-\\nment of different types of risk.\\nMeasuring Market Risk\\nMarket risk refers to the probability of and the expected value of a decrease\\nin market value due to market movements.

The capital invested in equity futures, for example, will\\nbe affected by price changes in equities underlying the futures as well as\\nby the changes in interest rates used to value the time component of the\\nfutures price. If the capital originates and is settled in EUR, but the invest-\\nment is placed into equity futures in the U.S. market, then EUR/USD price\\nchanges will also affect the value of the portfolio.\\nTo accurately estimate the risk of a given trading system, it is neces-\\nsary to have a reasonably complete idea of the returns generated by the\\ntrading system. The returns are normally described in terms of distribu-\\ntions. The preferred distributions of returns are obtained from running the\\nsystem on live capital. The back test obtained from running the model over\\nat least two years of tick data can also be used as a sample distribution of\\ntrade returns. However, the back-test distribution alone may be mislead-\\ning, because it may fail to account for all the extreme returns and hidden\\ncosts that occur when the system is trading live. Once the return distribu-\\ntions have been obtained, the risk metrics are most often estimated using\\nstatistical models and VaR in particular.\\nThe concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) has by now emerged as the dom-\\ninant metric in market risk management estimation. The VaR framework\\nspans two principal measures—VaR itself and the expected shortfall (ES).\\nVaR is the value of loss in case a negative scenario with the speciﬁed prob-\\nability should occur. The probability of the scenario is determined as a\\npercentile of the distribution of historical scenarios that can be strategy\\nor portfolio returns. For example, if the scenarios are returns from a par-\\nticular strategy and all the returns are arranged by their realized value in\\nascending order from the worst to the best, then the 95 percent VaR corre-\\nsponds to the cutoff return at the lowest ﬁfth percentile. In other words, if\\n100 sample observations are arranged from the lowest to the highest, then\\nVaR corresponds to the value of the ﬁfth lowest observation.\\nThe expected shortfall (ES) measure determines the average worst-\\ncase scenario among all scenarios at or below the prespeciﬁed threshold.\\nFor example, a 95 percent ES is the average return among all returns at the\\n5 percent or lower percentile. If 100 sample observations are arranged from\\nthe lowest to the highest, the ES is the average of observations 1 through\\n5. Figure 17.1 illustrates the concepts of VaR and ES.\\nAn analytical approximation to true VaR can be found by parameteriz-\\ning the sample distribution. The parametric VaR assumes that the obser-\\nvations are distributed in a normal fashion. Speciﬁcally, the parametric\\nVaR assumes that the 5 percent in the left tail of the observations fall at\\nµ − 1.65σof the distribution, where µ and σ represent the mean and stan-\\ndard deviation of the observations, respectively.

Despite all\\nthe criticism, VaR and ES have been mainstays of corporate risk manage-\\nment for years, where they present convenient reporting numbers.\\nTo alleviate the shortcomings of the VaR, many quantitative outﬁts\\nbegan to parameterize extreme tail distributions to develop fuller pictures\\nof extreme losses. Once the tail is parameterized based on the available\\ndata, the worst-case extreme events can be determined analytically from\\ndistributional functions, even though no extreme events of comparable\\nseverity were ever observed in the sample data.\\nThe parameterization of the tails is performed using the extreme value\\ntheory (EVT). EVT is an umbrella term spanning a range of tail model-\\ning functions. Dacorogna et al. (2001) note that all fat-tailed distributions\\nbelong to the family of Pareto distributions. A Pareto distribution family is\\ndescribed as follows:\\nG(x) =\\n{ 0 x ≤ 0\\nexp(−x−α) x > 0,α> 0 (17.1)\\nwhere the tail index α is the parameter that needs to be estimated from the\\nreturn data. For raw security returns, the tail index varies from ﬁnancial\\nsecurity to ﬁnancial security. Even for raw returns of the same ﬁnancial\\nsecurity, the tail index can vary from one quoting institution to another,\\nespecially for really high-frequency estimations.\\nWhen the tail index α is determined, we can estimate the magnitude\\nand probability of all the extreme events that may occur, given the extreme\\nevents that did occur in the sample. Figure 17.3 illustrates the process of\\nusing tail parameterization:\\n1. Sample return observations obtained from either a back test or live\\nresults are arranged in ascending order.\\n2.

This does not have to be the case. Managers with\\ndynamic strategies spanning different asset classes are likely to have time-\\nvarying dependencies on several benchmarks. Despite this shortcoming,\\nthe parametric bootstrap allows risk managers to glean a fuller notion of\\nthe true distribution of returns given the distribution of returns observed\\nin the sample.\\nTo incorporate portfolio managers’ benchmarks into the VaR frame-\\nwork, Suleiman, Shapiro, and Tepla (2005) propose analyzing the “track-\\ning error” of the manager’s return in excess of his benchmark. Suleiman,\\nShapiro, and Tepla (2005) deﬁne tracking error as a contemporaneous dif-\\nference between the manager’s return and the return on the manager’s\\nbenchmark index:\\nTE t = ln(Ri,t) − ln(RX,t) (17.4)\\nwhere Ri,t is the manager’s return at time t and Rx,t is return on the man-\\nager’s benchmark, also at time t. The VaR parameters are then estimated\\non the tracking error observations.\\nIn addition to VaR, statistical models may include Monte Carlo\\nsimulation–based methods to estimate future market values of capital at\\nrisk. The Monte Carlo simulations are often used in determining deriva-\\ntives exposure. Scenario analyses and causal models can be used to esti-\\nmate market risk as well. These auxiliary types of market risk estimation,\\nhowever, rely excessively on qualitative assessment and can, as a result, be\\nmisleading in comparison with VaR estimates, which are based on realized\\nhistorical performance.\\nMeasuring Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nThe credit and counterparty risk reﬂects the probability of ﬁnancial loss\\nshould one party in the trading equation not live up to its obligations. An\\nexample of losses due to a counterparty failure is a situation in which a\\nfund’s money is custodied with a broker-dealer, and the broker-dealer goes\\nbankrupt. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in October 2008 was the most\\nspectacular counterparty failure in recent memory.

The most prominent of these\\nagencies, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, came under ﬁre during the credit\\ncrisis of 2007–2008 because their ratings may have failed to capture the true\\ncredit and counterparty risk, and it was revealed that in many instances\\nthe rating agencies had cozy relationships with the ﬁrms they rated. As\\ncredit and counterparty data becomes increasingly available, it may make\\ngood sense for ﬁrms to statistically rate their counterparties internally. The\\nremainder of this section describes common techniques for measuring\\ncredit and counterparty risk.\\nEntities with publicly traded debt are the easiest counterparties to\\nrank. The lower the creditworthiness of the entity, the lower the market\\nprice on the senior debt issued by the entity and the higher the yield the\\nentity has to pay out to attract investors. The spread, or the difference\\nbetween the yield on the debt of the entity under consideration and the\\nyield on the government debt with comparable maturity, is a solid indi-\\ncator of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The higher the spread,\\nthe lower the creditworthiness of the counterparty. Because yields and\\nspreads are inversely related to the prices of the bonds, the creditworthi-\\nness of a counterparty can also be measured on the basis of the relative\\nbond price of the ﬁrm: the lower the bond price, the higher the yield and\\nthe lower the creditworthiness. Market prices of corporate debt provide\\nobjective information about the issuer’s creditworthiness. The prices are\\ndetermined by numerous market participants analyzing the ﬁrms’ strate-\\ngies and ﬁnancial prospects and arriving at their respective valuations.\\nTable 17.2 shows senior bond prices for selected ﬁrms and their rel-\\native creditworthiness rankings on May 15, 2009. A creditworthiness of\\n100 indicates solid ability to repay the debt, while a creditworthiness of\\n0 indicates the imminence of default. From the perspective of a fund decid-\\ning on May 15, 2009 whether to use Morgan Stanley or Wells Fargo & Co.\\nas its prime broker, for example, Morgan Stanley may be a better choice in\\nthat the ﬁrm shows higher creditworthiness and lower counterparty risk.\\nAs discussed in the section on implementation of risk management frame-\\nworks that follows, a diversiﬁcation of counterparties is the best way to\\nprotect the operation from credit and counterparty risk.\\nThe creditworthiness of private entities with unobservable market val-\\nues of obligations can be approximated as that of a public ﬁrm with match-\\ning factors.

The inability to close\\nout positions is normally due to low levels of market liquidity relative to\\nthe position size.

Bervas (2006) further suggests the distinction between the\\ntrading liquidity risk and the balance sheet liquidity risk, the latter being\\nthe inability to ﬁnance the shortfall in the balance sheet either through\\nliquidation or borrowing.\\nIn mild cases, liquidity risk can result in minor price slippages due to\\nthe delay in trade execution and can cause collapses of market systems\\nin its extreme. For example, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Manage-\\nment (LTCM) in 1998 can be attributed to the ﬁrm’s inability to promptly\\nofﬂoad its holdings. The credit crisis of 2008 was another vivid example of\\nliquidity risk; as the credit crisis spread, seemingly high-quality debt instru-\\nments such as high-grade CDOs lost most of their value when the markets\\nfor these securities vanished. Many ﬁrms holding long positions in these\\nsecurities suffered severe losses. Another, simpler, example of liquidity\\nrisk is provided by out-of-the-money options nearing expiration; the mar-\\nkets for out-of-the-money options about to become worthless disappear\\nentirely.\\nThe number of transacting parties usually depends on the potential\\nproﬁtability and degree of regulation in the trades of interest. No one is in-\\nclined to buy worthless options just before the options expire. In the case\\nof CDOs in the fall of 2008, the absence of markets was largely due to reg-\\nulation FAS 133 enacted in 2007. FAS 133 mandates that all securities be\\nmarked to their market prices. In the case of CDOs, for example, the mar-\\nket price is the last trade price recorded for the security by the ﬁrm holding\\nCDOs in its portfolio. As a result of this regulation, the ﬁrms that held CDOs\\nat 100 percent of their face value on the books refused to sell a portion of\\ntheir CDOs at a lower price. The sale would result in devaluation of their\\nremaining CDOs at the lower market price, which would trigger devalua-\\ntion of the fund as a whole and would, in turn, result in increased investor\\nredemptions. At the same time, potential buyers of the CDOs faced a sim-\\nilar problem: those already holding CDOs on their books at 100 percent of\\nface value would face sharp devaluations of their entire funds if they chose\\nto purchase new CDOs at signiﬁcantly reduced prices. The recently pro-\\nposed taxation scheme of charging transaction costs on trading as a tax\\nmay similarly destroy the liquidity of currently liquid instruments.\\nTo properly assess the liquidity risk exposure of a portfolio, it is nec-\\nessary to take into account all potential portfolio liquidation costs, includ-\\ning the opportunity costs associated with any delays in execution. While\\nliquidation costs are stable and are easy to estimate during periods with\\nlittle volatility, the liquidation costs can vary wildly during high-volatility\\nregimes. Bangia et al. (1999), for example, document that liquidity risk ac-\\ncounted for 17 percent of the market risk in long USD/THB positions in\\nMay 1997, and Le Saout (2002) estimates that liquidity risk can reach over\\n50 percent of total risk on selected securities in CAC40 stocks.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='cad4967b-f309-4764-8c3a-c79018fe645e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '278', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc17 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 17:49 Printer: Yet to come\\n264 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nBervas (2006) proposes the following liquidity-adjusted VaR measure:\\nVaRL = VaR + Liquidity Adjustment = VaR −\\n(\\nµS + zασS)\\n(17.7)\\nwhere VaR is the market risk value-at-risk discussed previously in this\\nchapter, µS is the mean expected bid-ask spread, σS is the standard devia-\\ntion of the bid-ask spread, and zα is the conﬁdence coefﬁcient correspond-\\ning to the desired α– percent of the VaR estimation.

The causal analysis iden-\\ntiﬁes the key risk indicators embedded in the current legal contracts of the\\nﬁrm and then works to quantify possible outcomes caused by changes in\\nthe key risk indicators. As with other types of risk, the output of legal risk\\nanalysis is a VaR number, a legal loss that has the potential to occur with\\njust a 5 percent probability for a 95 percent VaR estimate.\\nMANAGING RISK\\nOnce market risk has been estimated, a market risk management frame-\\nwork can be established to minimize the adverse impact of the market risk\\non the trading operation. Most risk management systems work in the fol-\\nlowing two ways:\\n1. Stop losses—stop current transaction(s) to prevent further losses\\n2. Hedging—hedge risk exposure with complementary ﬁnancial instru-\\nments\\nStop Losses\\nA stop loss is the crudest and most indispensable risk management tech-\\nnique to manage the risk of unexpected losses. In the case of market risk,\\na stop loss is a threshold price of a given security, which, if crossed by\\nthe market price, triggers liquidation of the current position. In credit and\\ncounterparty risk, a stop loss is a level of counterparty creditworthiness be-\\nlow which the trading operation makes a conscious decision to stop deal-\\ning with the deteriorating counterparty. In liquidity risk, the stop loss is\\nthe minimum level of liquidity that warrants opened positions in a given\\nsecurity. In operations risk, the stop loss is a set of conditions according\\nto which a particular operational aspect is reviewed and terminated, if nec-\\nessary. For example, compromised Internet security may mandate a com-\\nplete shutdown of trading operations until the issue is resolved. Finally, a\\nstop loss in legal risk can be a settlement when otherwise incurred legal\\nexpenses are on track to exceed the predetermined stop-loss level.\\nIn market risk management, a simple stop loss deﬁnes a ﬁxed level of\\nthe threshold price. For example, if at 12:00 P.M. EST we bought USD/CAD\\nat 1.2000 and set a simple stop loss at 50 bps, the position will be liqui-\\ndated whenever the level of USD/CAD drops below 1.1950, provided the\\nposition is not closed sooner for some other reason.

For example, suppose we\\nagain bought USD/CAD at 12:00P.M. EST at 1.2000 and set a trailing stop\\nloss at 50 bps. Suppose further that by 12:15 P.M. EST the market price for\\nUSD/CAD rose to 1.2067, but by 13:30 P.M. EST the market price dropped\\ndown to 1.1940. The trailing stop loss would be triggered at 50 bps less the\\nmarket price corresponding to the highest local maximum of the gain func-\\ntion. In our example, the local maximum of gain appeared at 1.2067 when\\nthe position gain was 1.2067−1.2000 = 0.0067. The corresponding trailing\\nstop loss would be hit as soon as the market price for USD/CAD dipped\\nbelow 1.2067 –50 bps = 1.2017, resulting in a realized proﬁt of 17 bps, a big\\nimprovement over performance with a simple stop loss. Figure 17.4, panel\\n(b) shows the process.\\nHow does one determine the appropriate level of the stop-loss thresh-\\nold? If the stop-loss threshold is too narrow, the position may be closed\\ndue to short-term variations in prices or even due to variation in the bid-ask\\nspread. If the stop-loss threshold is too wide, the position may be closed\\ntoo late, resulting in severe drawdowns. As a result, many trading practi-\\ntioners calibrate the stop-loss thresholds to the intrinsic volatility of the\\ntraded security. For example, if a position is opened during high-volatility\\nconditions with price bouncing wildly, a trader will set wide stop losses.

Average gain of the trading system without stop losses in place, E[G]\\n2. Average loss of the trading system without stop losses in place, E[L]\\nThe probabilities of a particular position turning out positive also play\\na role in determining the optimal stop-loss threshold, but their role is a\\nmuch smaller one than that of the averages. The main reason for the rel-\\native insigniﬁcance of probabilities of relative occurrence of gains and\\nlosses is that per the Gambler’s Ruin Problem, the probability of a gain\\nmust always exceed the probability of a loss on any given trade; otherwise,\\nthe system faces the certainty of bankruptcy. Please refer to Chapter 10 for\\ndetails.\\nThe information on average upside and downside is typically deter-\\nmined from the system’s back test. The back test normally spans at least\\ntwo years of data and produces a sample return distribution with a number\\nof observations sufﬁcient to draw unbiased inferences about the distribu-\\ntion of the return population with the use of the techniques such as VaR, tail\\nparameterization, or benchmarked performance measurement, discussed\\nsubsequently. Armed with distributional information about returns of the\\ntrading system, we can estimate the maximum (trailing) loss allowed that\\nwould keep our system consistently positive. The maximum trailing stop\\nloss,LM, has to satisfy the following three conditions:\\n1. In absolute terms, the maximum loss is always less than the average\\ngain,|LM | < E[G]; otherwise, the system can produce negative cumu-\\nlative results.\\n2. Also in absolute terms, the maximum loss is always less than the aver-\\nage loss, |LM |≤| E[L]|; otherwise, the system can deliver almost iden-\\ntical results with no stop losses.\\n3. After the introduction of stop losses, the probability of a gain still ex-\\nceeds the probability of a loss in a back test.\\nOnce the maximum stop loss is determined, the stop loss can be fur-\\nther reﬁned to tighten dynamically in response to different volatility con-\\nditions. Dynamic calibration of stop losses to market volatility is more\\nart than science. Dacorogna et al. (2001), for example, describe a moving\\naverage–based model with stop losses of low-volatility and high-volatility', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ac13f181-2d09-43a2-a368-97ddad435971', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '283', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc17 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 17:49 Printer: Yet to come\\nRisk Management 269\\nregimes. Dacorogna et al. (2001) use the absolute value of the gain or loss\\nas a proxy for “volatility” and consider “volatility” to be low if the absolute\\ngain or loss is less than 0.5 percent (50 bps). The model thresholds change\\nin accordance with the volatility conditions. In Dacorogna et al. (2001), for\\nexample, the thresholds increase 10 times their low-volatility value when\\nthe “volatility” deﬁned previously exceeds 0.5 percent. The low-volatility\\nparameter is calibrated in the back test on the historical data.\\nThe stop-loss thresholds in other types of risk are similarly determined\\nbased on the expected market gain and total maximum loss considerations\\npresented previously.\\nHedging Portfolio Exposure\\nHedging is closely related to portfolio optimization: the objective of any\\nhedging operation is to create a portfolio that maximizes returns while\\nminimizing risk—downside risk in particular. Hedging can also be thought\\nof as a successful payoff matching: the negative payoffs of one security\\n“neutralized” by positive payoffs of another.\\nHedging can be passive or dynamic. Passive risk hedging is most akin\\nto insurance. The manager enters into a position in a ﬁnancial security with\\nthe risk characteristics that offset the long-term negative returns of the\\noperation. For example, a manager whose main trading strategy involves\\nﬁnding fortuitous times for being long in USD/CAD may want to go short\\nin the USD/CAD futures contract to offset his exposure to USD/CAD. As\\nalways, detailed analysis of the risk characteristics of the two securities is\\nrequired to make such a decision.\\nDynamic hedging is most often done through a series of short-term, po-\\ntentially overlapping, insurance-like contracts. The objective of the short-\\nterm insurance contracts is to manage the short-term characteristics of\\ntrading returns. In the case of market risk hedging, dynamic hedging may\\nbe developed for a particular set of recurring market conditions, when\\nbehaviors of the trading systems may repeat themselves. It may be possible\\nto ﬁnd a set of ﬁnancial securities or trading strategies the returns of which\\nwould offset the downside of the primary trading strategy during these par-\\nticular market conditions. For example, during a U.S. Fed announcement\\nabout the level of interest rates, the USD/CAD exchange rate is likely to\\nrise following a rise in the U.S. interest rates, while U.S. bond prices are\\nlikely to fall following the same announcement. Depending upon return\\ndistributions for USD/CAD and U.S. bonds, it may make sense to trade the\\ntwo together during the U.S. interest rate announcements in order to off-\\nset the negative tail risk in either. Mapping out extensive distributions of\\nreturns as described previously in this chapter would help in determining\\nthe details of such a dynamic hedging operation.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='6558f737-234a-4964-8902-bf0e27cb2774', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '284', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc17 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 17:49 Printer: Yet to come\\n270 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nAs with mean-variance portfolio construction, a successful hedging\\nstrategy solves the following optimization problem:\\nmax xE [R] − Ax ′Vx\\ns.t. ∑ xi = 1 (17.11)\\nwhere xi is the portfolio weight of security i, i ∈ [1,..., I], E[R] is a vector\\nof expected returns ofI securities, V is an I × I variance-covariance matrix\\nof returns, and A is the coefﬁcient reﬂecting the risk aversion of the trad-\\ning operation.

The counterparty risk, for example, can be diversiﬁed\\nthrough establishment of several ongoing broker-dealer relationships. Citi\\nprime brokerage even markets itself as a secondary broker-dealer for funds\\nalready transacting, or “priming,” with another broker-dealer.\\nSimilarly, liquidity risk can be diversiﬁed away through using several\\nliquidity providers.

Before the introduction of\\ncomputer-enabled trading optimization algorithms, investors desiring to\\ntrade large blocks of equity shares or other ﬁnancial instruments may have\\nhired a broker-dealer to ﬁnd a counterparty for the entire order. Subse-\\nquently, broker-dealers developed “best execution” services that split up\\nthe order to gradually process it with limited impact on the price. The ad-\\nvent of algorithmic trading allowed institutional traders to optimize trading\\non their own, minimizing the dominance of broker-dealers and capturing a\\ngreater proﬁt margin as a result.\\nOptimization algorithms take into account a variety of current market\\nconditions as well as characteristics of the orders to be processed: order\\ntype, size, and frequency. Bertsimas and Lo (1998) developed optimization\\nstrategies to take advantage of contemporary price changes. Engle and\\nFerstenberg (2007) examined the risks embedded in execution. Almgren\\nand Chriss (2000) and Alam and Tkatch (2007), among others, studied the\\neffects of “slicing” up orders into batches of smaller size. Obizhaeva and\\nWang (2005) optimize execution, assuming that post-trade liquidity is not\\nreplenished immediately. Kissell and Malamut (2006) adapt the speed of\\norder processing to traders’ current beliefs about the impending direction\\nof market prices.\\nIn addition to algorithms optimizing the total execution cost of trad-\\ning, algorithms have been developed to optimize liquidity supply, hedge\\npositions, and even to optimize the effort extended in monitoring position\\nchanges in the marketplace. See Foucault, Roell and Sandas (2003) for an\\nexample of the latter. In this chapter, we consider three common forms of\\nexecuting optimization algorithms:\\n1. Trading-aggressiveness selection algorithms, designed to choose\\nbetween market and limit orders for optimal execution\\n2.

Size-optimization algorithms that determine the optimal ways to break\\ndown large trading lots into smaller parcels to minimize adverse costs\\n(e.g., the cost of market impact)\\nMarket-Aggressiveness Selection\\nAggressive execution refers to high trading frequency and to short trading\\nintervals that may lead to high market impact. Aggressive execution most\\noften skews toward the heavy use of market orders. Passive trading, on\\nthe other hand, is lower frequency, depends more on limit orders, but may\\nbe subject to non-execution risk should the market move adversely. To\\nbalance passive and aggressive trading, Almgren and Chriss (1999) propose\\nthe following optimization:\\nmin\\nα\\nCost(α) + λ Risk(α) (18.1)\\nwhere α is the trading rate often calculated as a percentage of volume\\n(POV) or liquidity that the strategy absorbs during the trading period andλ\\nis the coefﬁcient of risk aversion of the investor. Plotting cost/risk proﬁles\\nfor various algorithms identiﬁes efﬁcient trading frontiers that are well-\\nsuited for comparisons of algorithm efﬁciencies and for determining the\\nsuitability of a particular algorithm to the trading needs of a particular\\ninvestor.\\nAccording to Kissell and Malamut (2005), market aggressiveness (POV\\nor α) can be varied using a combination of market and limit orders. Market\\norders tend to increase the POV orα, whereas limit orders decrease market\\naggressiveness.\\nThe cost and risk functions used in the optimization equation (18.1)\\nare deﬁned as follows:\\nCost(α) = E0 [P(α) − Pb] (18.2)\\nRisk(α) = σ(ε(α)) (18.3)\\nP(α) = P + f (X,α ) + g(X) + ε(α) (18.4)\\nwhere E0 denotes the ex-ante expectation at the start of the trading\\nperiod,\\nPb is the benchmark execution price,\\nP(α) is the realized execution price deﬁned in equation (18.4),\\nε(α) is a random deviation of the trading outcome, E[ε(α)] =\\n0, Var[ε(α)] = σ2(α).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9394bcd5-2f5c-488e-89fb-e6b18a9b97ed', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '290', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc18 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 13:17 Printer: Yet to come\\n276 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nP is the market price at the time of order entry,\\nf (X,α ) is a temporary market impact due to the liquidity\\ndemand of trading, and\\ng(X) is the permanent price impact due to information leakage\\nduring order execution.\\nPrice-Scaling Strategies\\nThe main objective of so-called price-scaling execution algorithms is to\\nobtain the best price for the strategy. The best price can be attained rel-\\native to a benchmark—for example, the average daily price for a given se-\\ncurity. The best price can also be attained given the utility function of the\\nend investor or a target Sharpe ratio of a portfolio manager.\\nThe algorithm that minimizes the cost of execution relative to a bench-\\nmark is known as a Strike algorithm. The Strike is designed to capture gains\\nin periods of favorable prices; the algorithm is aggressive (executes at mar-\\nket prices) in times of favorable prices and passive (places limit orders) in\\ntimes of unfavorable prices. The Strike strategy dynamically adjusts the\\npercent of volume rate α used to process market orders of the strategy to\\nminimize the quadratic execution cost of the strategy:\\nmin\\nαt\\nEt\\n[\\nPt+1(αt) − Pb,t\\n]2\\n(18.5)\\nwhere Pt+1(αt) is the realized price obtained using the trading aggressive-\\nness level αt decided upon at time t, and Pb,t is the benchmark price at time\\nt used to compare the trading performance.\\nThe Plus algorithm maximizes the probability of outperforming a spec-\\niﬁed benchmark while minimizing risk. To do so, the algorithm maximizes\\nthe following Sharpe ratio–like speciﬁcation:\\nmax\\nαt\\nEt\\n[\\nPt+1(αt) − Pb,t\\n]\\n(V (Pt+1(αt) − Pb,t))1/2 (18.6)\\nwhere, as before, Pb,t is the benchmark price at time t used to compare the\\ntrading performance, and Pt+1(αt) is the realized price obtained using the\\ntrading aggressiveness level αt decided upon at time t.\\nFinally, the Wealth algorithm maximizes investor wealth in the pres-\\nence of uncertainty. The Wealth algorithm is passive during periods of fa-\\nvorable prices, but acts aggressively during periods of unfavorable prices\\nwith the goal of preserving the investor’s wealth in adverse conditions. The\\nWealth strategy is obtained by optimizing the following expression:\\nmax\\nαt\\nlog Et [U(Pt+1(αt))] (18.7)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b0510315-2263-428c-89a3-716549c2310a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '291', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc18 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 13:17 Printer: Yet to come\\nExecuting and Monitoring High-Frequency Trading 277\\nwhere U(.) is a utility function approximating the risk-return preferences of\\nthe investor. The utility function may be the one shown in equation (18.8):\\nU(x) = E[x] − λV [x] (18.8)\\nwhere x is the realized payoff and λ is the risk aversion coefﬁcient of the\\ninvestor. The risk-aversion coefﬁcient λ is 0 for a risk-neutral investor, or\\nan investor insensitive to risk. A risk-averse investor will have λ greater\\nthan 0; λ of 0.5 and above would characterize a highly risk-averse investor.\\nThe proﬁtability of execution algorithms depends on concurrent mar-\\nket conditions. Kissell and Malamut (2005) compared the three execution\\nstrategies in detail and found that all three strategies consistently outper-\\nform random, nonsystematic execution. Among the algorithms, the Strike\\nmethod delivers a lower average cost but ignores participation in favor-\\nable price conditions. The Plus strategy also delivers a low average cost,\\nbut increases the risk of unfavorable prices. Finally, the Wealth strategy is\\nable to capture a greater proportion of favorable price conditions but at the\\nexpense of higher average prices.\\nSlicing Large Orders\\nKyle (1985) and Admati and Pﬂeiderer (1988) were the ﬁrst to suggest that\\nfor informed investors to proﬁt from their information, they need to trade\\nin a fashion that precludes other market participants from recognizing the\\ninformed investors’ order ﬂow. Should other investors recognize the or-\\nder ﬂow of informed investors, they could front-run the informed parties,\\ndiluting their proﬁtability. Barclay and Warner (1993) argue that for insti-\\ntutions to trade with their positions undetected, their large order packets\\nneed to be broken up into parcels of medium size—not too big and not\\ntoo small—in order to minimize other trading participants’ ability to distin-\\nguish these orders from other, “noise,” orders. Chakravarty (2001) studies\\nthe impact of stealth trading—that is, trading by breaking down large trad-\\ning blocks into small order parcels with the intent of causing the least mar-\\nket impact. Chakravarty (2001) ﬁnds that, consistent with the hypotheses\\nof Barclay and Warner (1993), medium-sized orders indeed are followed\\nby disproportionally large price changes, relative to all price and overall\\nproportion of trades and volume.\\nAlam and Tkatch (2007) analyzed data from the Tel-Aviv Stock Ex-\\nchange to study the performance of institutional investors who slice their\\norders into blocks of equal size in order to avoid being detected and picked\\noff by other traders.

Com-\\npletely executed orders have a ﬁll rate of 100 percent; the order that failed\\nto execute has a ﬁll rate of 0 percent. Regular, non-sliced, orders may en-\\ncounter a partial ﬁll, depending on the order size. Alam and Tkatch (2007)\\nshow that non-sliced orders have a ﬁll rate of 40 percent, while sliced or-\\nders have a ﬁll rate of 48 percent. Slicing particularly improves the ﬁll rate\\nof limit orders; regular limit orders have a ﬁll rate of 42 percent, while sliced\\nlimit orders have a ﬁll rate of 77 percent.\\nSliced orders are executed more quickly. Alam and Tkatch (2007)\\nreport that the mean execution time for a fully ﬁlled sliced order is 3 min-\\nutes and 29 seconds, while the mean execution time for a regular order is\\n11 minutes and 54 seconds.\\nExecution is costly not only in terms of the average transaction costs\\nbut in terms of risks associated with execution. The risk embedded in ex-\\necution comprises primarily two types of risk: (1) the uncertainty of the\\nprice at which market orders are executed and (2) the uncertainty in the\\ntiming of the execution of limit orders and the associated opportunity cost.\\nExtreme examples of such costs include the possible failure to execute a\\nlimit order and an insufﬁcient market depth at a reasonable range of prices\\nfor market order execution.\\nExecution risk creates an additional dimension for portfolio\\nrisk/return optimization and has to be taken into account. Engle and\\nFerstenberg (2006) propose that the study of possible execution risks is\\nnecessary to determine the following aspects of portfolio management:\\nr Is risk-neutral portfolio management optimal in the presence of execu-\\ntion risks?\\nr Is execution risk diversiﬁable in a portfolio of several ﬁnancial instru-\\nments?\\nr Can execution risk be hedged?\\nInstead of executing the total order size at the same time, institutions\\nemploy strategies to minimize market impact by, for example, splitting\\nthe total order size into discrete blocks executed over time, often sev-\\neral days.

Several recent studies have characterized properties of liquid-\\nity that may assist managers in forecasting liquidity going forward; specif-\\nically, liquidity has been shown to be time varying, yet persistent from\\none period to the next. These studies include those of Chordia, Roll, and\\nSubrahmanyam (2001, 2002); Hasbrouck and Seppi (2001); and Huberman\\nand Halka (2001).\\nObizhaeva and Wang (2005) analytically derive optimal execution sizes\\ndepending on the execution horizon of the trade and the “speed of recov-\\nery” of the limit order book for a given security. The speed of recovery\\nis a measure of how fast the limit order book absorbs the market impact\\ngenerated by the previous lot in the execution sequence. Obizhaeva and\\nWang (2005) ﬁnd that for securities with a reasonable speed of limit order\\nbook recovery, the optimal trading strategy is to process large lots at the\\nbeginning and at the end of the execution period with small lots spaced\\nin between. The spacing of smaller lots depends on whether the speed of\\nrecovery for the traded security is uniform throughout the day. If the speed\\nof recovery is not uniform throughout the day, larger lots should be pro-\\ncessed at times with higher speeds of recovery.\\nNevmyvaka, Kearns, Papandreou, and Sycara (2006) have developed\\nan algorithm for optimizing execution through a dynamic combination of\\nmarket and limit orders. The optimization is focused on a speciﬁc task:\\nto acquireV shares of a particular ﬁnancial security within T seconds of\\nthe order. The authors compare the following three market and limit order\\nexecution scenarios to obtain a certain number of shares,V:\\n1. Submit a market order for V shares immediately at the beginning of\\nthe trading period, time 0. This approach guarantees execution, but\\nthe liquidity required to fulﬁll the order may be costly; the trader may\\nneed to explore the depth of the book at suboptimal prices and wide\\nbid-ask spreads.\\n2. Wait until the end of the trading period and submit a market order forV\\nshares at time T. This strategy may improve upon the obtained price,\\nbut it is also subject to market volatility risks. Full bid-ask spread is\\npresent.\\n3. Submit a limit order for V shares at the beginning of the trading period\\n(time 0) and a market order for the unexecuted shares (if any) at the\\nend of the trading period (time T). This strategy avoids paying bid-ask\\nspread if the limit order is executed. The worst-case outcome of this\\nstrategy is that presented in case 2.\\nIn all three scenarios, the trading period ends with the same number\\nof shares, V. In each scenario, however, the V shares can potentially be\\nobtained at a different cost.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='845c9b9f-ea06-46d5-b770-f06b8416f2fe', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '294', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc18 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 13:17 Printer: Yet to come\\n280 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nNevmyvaka, Kearns, Papandreou, and Sycara (2006) found that the\\nbest strategy is strategy 3, with limit orders placed at the beginning of the\\ntrading period and besting the market price by one tick size.

Even the smallest deviations in\\ntrading costs, for example, can destroy the proﬁtability of high-frequency\\ntrading strategies capturing minute bursts of price movements. As a result,\\nrun-time monitoring of trading conditions is critical to successful imple-\\nmentation of high-frequency strategies.\\nMonitoring trading performance can be delegated to a designated hu-\\nman trader armed with an array of dynamically updated performance\\ngauges. Kissell and Malamut (2005) list the following metrics of trading\\nperformance as desirable tools for performance monitoring:\\n1. Allowable deviation in the price of the traded instrument from the tar-\\nget execution price ensures that the execution is suspended whenever\\nthe market impact costs become too high for the strategy to remain\\nproﬁtable. For example, a strategy with an average net per-trade gain\\nof 5 bps or pips can sustain the maximum market impact costs of 4 bps\\nor pips. A market impact cost of 5 bps or more renders the strategy\\nunproﬁtable.\\n2. Processing market orders in high-volume conditions limits the market\\nimpact of the strategy and increases proﬁtability. Specifying the mini-\\nmum level of volume allowable to run the strategy caps market impact\\ncosts.\\n3. The longer the limit orders have been outstanding, the higher is the\\nprobability that the market price has moved away from the limit or-\\nder prices, increasing the risk of non-execution. Specifying the maxi-\\nmum allowable duration of orders reduces the risk of non-execution:\\nif a limit order is not executed within the prespeciﬁed time period, the\\norder is either canceled or executed at market.\\nCONCLUSION\\nSuccessful execution is key to ensuring proﬁtability of high-frequency\\nstrategies. Various algorithms have been developed to optimize execution.\\nFurthermore, a human trader tasked with observing the trading parame-\\nters should have strict directions for termination of outstanding positions.\\nSuch oversight ensures smooth operation and swift reaction to disruptive\\nand potentially costly events.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1f762198-ea62-4dfc-b8a4-ca696e168f3d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '296', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc18 JWBT188-Aldridge October 22, 2009 13:17 Printer: Yet to come\\n282', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7bdf4dec-7dc4-4300-845b-06d8118f86ad', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '297', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\nCHAPTER 19\\nPost-Trade\\nProﬁtability\\nAnalysis\\nT\\nrading costs can make and break the proﬁtability of a high-\\nfrequency trading strategy.

Cost analysis—realized execution costs for all live trading strategies\\n2. Performance analysis—execution performance relative to a bench-\\nmark.\\nPost-trade analyses can be run after each trade, as well as at the end\\nof each trading day. The analyses are often programmed to start and run\\nautomatically and to generate consistent daily reports. The reports are gen-\\nerated for each trading strategy and are studied by every portfolio manager\\nor strategist and every trader, if any are involved in the execution process.\\nCost analysis and benchmarking analysis are discussed in the sections that\\nfollow.\\nPOST-TRADE COST ANALYSIS\\nAnalysis of execution costs begins with identiﬁcation and estimation of\\ncosts by type and as they are incurred in an individual trade, in a trad-\\ning strategy, by a portfolio manager, or by an execution trader. Execution\\ncosts are the trading fees or commissions paid by either the buyer or the\\nseller but not received by the buyer or the seller. A novice may assume that\\ntrading costs comprise only the broker commissions and exchange fees. In\\nreality, most trades incur at least nine types of cost, most of which are not\\nobservable directly and require a rigorous estimation process. The most\\ncommon execution costs are the following:\\nr Transparent execution costs:\\nr Broker commissions—ﬁxed and variable components\\nr Exchange fees\\nr Taxes\\nr Latent execution costs:\\nr Bid-ask spread\\nr Investment delay\\nr Price appreciation\\nr Market impact\\nr Timing risk\\nr Opportunity cost\\nCosts known prior to trading activity are referred to as “transparent”\\nor “explicit,” and costs that have to be estimated are known as “latent” or\\n“implicit.” According to Kissell and Glantz (2003), while the transparent', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='56dc3c57-94a1-4c83-92aa-2a8815d567ba', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '299', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\nPost-Trade Proﬁtability Analysis 285\\ncosts are known with certainty prior to trading, latent costs can only be es-\\ntimated from the costs’ historical distribution inferred from the data of past\\ntrades. The goal of estimating latent cost values is to remove the pre-trade\\nuncertainty about these costs during execution. Once all applicable execu-\\ntion costs have been identiﬁed and estimated, cost information is relayed\\nto the trading team to ﬁnd ways to deliver better, more cost-efﬁcient execu-\\ntion. At a minimum, the cost analysis should produce cost estimates in the\\nformat shown in Table 19.1. The mechanics of identiﬁcation and estimation\\nof each type of execution cost are described in the following sections.\\nTransparent Execution Costs\\nBroker Commissions Brokers charge fees and commissions to cover\\nthe costs of their businesses, which provide connectivity to different ex-\\nchanges and inter-dealer networks. Broker commissions can have both\\nﬁxed and variable components. The ﬁxed component can be a ﬂat commis-\\nsion per month or a ﬂat charge per trade, often with a per-trade minimum.\\nThe variable component is typically proportional to the size of each trade,\\nwith higher trade sizes incurring lower costs.\\nBrokers set custom price schedules to differentiate their businesses.\\nThe differences in cost estimates from one executing broker to another\\ncan be signiﬁcant, because some brokers may quote lower fees for a par-\\nticular set of securities while charging premium rates on other trading\\ninstruments.\\nBroker commissions may also depend on the total business the broker\\nreceives from a given ﬁrm, as well as on the extent of “soft-dollar” trans-\\nactions that the broker provides in addition to direct execution services.\\nBrokers’ commissions typically cover the following services:\\nr Trade commissions\\nr Interest and ﬁnancing fees\\nr Market data and news charges\\nr Research\\nr Other miscellaneous fees\\nSome broker-dealers may charge their customers additional fees for\\naccess to streaming market data and other premium information, such as\\nproprietary research. Others may charge separately for a host of incremen-\\ntal miscellaneous fees.\\nBroker commissions generally come in two forms—bundled and un-\\nbundled.

The unbundled fees account for exchange fees and\\nbroker commissions separately. Since exchanges charge different rates,\\nthe unbundled fee structures allow investors to minimize the commissions\\nthey pay. Equity brokers charge USD 0.0001 to USD 0.003 commissions\\nper share of stock traded through them in addition to the exchange fees,\\ndiscussed in the following section. Similarly, in foreign exchange, some\\nbroker-dealers offer “no commission” platforms by pricing all costs in the\\nincreased bid-ask spreads. Others go to the opposite extreme and price all\\ntrades according to the “unbundled” list of minute trade features.\\nBroker-dealers also differ on the interest they pay their clients on cash\\naccounts as well as on the ﬁnancing fees they charge their clients for ser-\\nvices such as margin ﬁnancing and other forms of leverage. The cash ac-\\ncount is the portion of the total capital that is not deployed by the trading\\nstrategy. For example, if the total size of the account a ﬁrm custodies with\\na broker-dealer is $100,000,000, and out of this amount one actively trades\\nonly $20,000,000, the remaining $80,000,000 remains “in cash” in the ac-\\ncount. Brokers typically use this cash to advance loans to other customers.\\nBrokers pay the cash account owners interest on the passive cash balance;\\nthe interest is often the benchmark rate less a fraction of a percent. The\\nbenchmark rate is typically the Fed Funds rate for the USD-denominated\\ncash accounts and the central-bank equivalents for deposits in other cur-\\nrencies. A sample rate may be quoted as LIBOR minus 0.1 percent, for ex-\\nample. Brokers usually charge the benchmark rate plus a spread (0.05 per-\\ncent – 1 percent) for ﬁnancing borrowing investors’ leverage and generate\\nincome on the spread between their borrowing and lending activities. The\\nspread ideally reﬂects the creditworthiness of the borrower.\\nBroker commissions are negotiated well in advance of execution.\\nDetailed understanding of broker commission costs allows optimization of\\nper-order cost structures by bundling orders for several strategies together\\nor by disaggregating orders into smaller chunks.\\nExchange Fees Exchanges match orders from different broker-dealers\\nor electronic communication networks (ECNs) and charge fees for their\\nservices. The core product of every exchange is the inventory of open buy\\nand sell interest that traders are looking to transact on the exchange. To\\nattract liquidity, exchanges charge higher fees for orders consuming liquid-\\nity than for orders supplying liquidity.

The following example illustrates the\\nconcept of the investment delay cost. The trading strategy identiﬁes a stock\\n(e.g., IBM) to be a buy at $56.50, but by the time the market buy order\\nis executed, the market price moves up to $58.00. In this case, the $1.50\\ndifferential between the desired price and the price obtained on execution\\nis the cost of the investment delay.\\nIn systematic high-frequency trading environments, investment delay\\ncosts are generated by the following circumstances:\\n1. Interruptions in network communications may disrupt timely execu-\\ntion and can delay transmission of orders.\\n2. The clearing counterparty may experience an overload of simultane-\\nous orders, resulting in an order-processing backlog and subsequent\\ndelay in execution. Such situations most often occur in high-volatility\\nenvironments. In the absence of large-scale disruptions, delays due to\\nhigh trading volume can last for up to a few seconds.\\nThe cost of investment delays can range from a few basis points in\\nless volatile markets to tens of basis points in very liquid and volatile se-\\ncurities such as the EUR/USD exchange rate. The investment delay costs\\nare random and cannot be known with precision in advance of a trade.\\nDistribution of investment delay costs inferred from past trades, however,\\ncan produce the expected cost value to be used within the trading strategy\\ndevelopment process.\\nWhile the investment delay costs cannot be fully eliminated, even with\\ncurrent technology, the costs can be minimized. Backup communication\\nsystems and continuous human supervision of trading activity can detect\\nnetwork problems and route orders to their destinations along alter-\\nnative backup channels, ensuring a continuous transmission of trading\\ninformation.\\nPrice Appreciation Costs The price appreciation cost refers to the\\nloss of investment value during the execution of a large position. A position\\nof considerable size may not be immediately absorbed by the market and\\nmay need to be “sliced” into smaller blocks. 1 The smaller blocks are then\\nexecuted one block at a time over a certain time period.

Such loss in value is known as price appreciation cost and can be\\nestimated using information on past trades. The price appreciation cost\\nis different from the market impact cost, or the adverse change in price\\ngenerated by the trading activity itself, discussed subsequently.\\nFor an example of the price appreciation cost, consider the following\\nEUR/USD trade. Suppose that a trading strategy determines that EUR/USD\\nis undervalued at 1.3560, and a buy order of $100 million EUR/USD is\\nplaced that must be executed over the next three minutes. The forecast\\nturns out to be correct, and EUR/USD appreciates to 1.3660 over the fol-\\nlowing two minutes. The price appreciation cost is therefore 50 bps per\\nminute. Note that the price appreciation cost is due to the fundamental\\nappreciation of price, not the trading activity in EUR/USD.\\nMarket Impact Costs Market impact cost measures the adverse\\nchange in the market price due to the execution of a market order. More\\nprecisely, the cost of market impact is the loss of investment value caused\\nby the reduction in liquidity following market order–driven trades.\\nEvery market order reduces available liquidity and causes a change\\nin the price of the traded security. A market buy order reduces the avail-\\nable supply of the security and causes an instantaneous appreciation in\\nthe price of the security. A market sell order decreases the demand for\\nthe security and causes an instantaneous depreciation in the price of the\\nsecurity.\\nThe market impact may be due to the imbalances in inventories created\\nby the order, to the order pressures on the supply or demand, or to the\\ninformational content of the trades signaling an undervalued security to\\nother market participants. Market impact is most pronounced when large\\norders are executed. Breaking orders into smaller, standard-size “clips” or\\n“rounds” has been shown to alleviate the market impact. The properties of\\nmarket impact can be described as follows:\\n1. When the limit order book is not observable, ex-ante expectations of\\nmarket impact are the same for buy and sell orders in normal trading\\nconditions. In other words, in the absence of information it can with\\nreasonable accuracy be assumed that the number of limit buys out-\\nstanding in the market equals the number of limit sells. However, if the\\nlimit order book can be observed, market impact can be calculated pre-\\ncisely based on the limit orders present in the order book by “walking”\\nthe order through the order book.\\n2.

Market impact due to inventory effects is transient. In other words,\\nif any price appreciation following a buy order is due to our execut-\\ning broker’s “digestion” of the order and not to market news, the price\\nis likely to revert to its normal levels after the executing broker has\\nﬁnished “digesting” the order. Whether the market impact cost is tran-\\nsient or permanent depends on the beliefs and actions of other market\\nparticipants.\\n4. Market impact accompanies market orders only; limit orders do not\\nincur market impact costs.\\n5. The informational content of market impact is canceled out by oppos-\\ning orders.\\nIn ideal market conditions, the market impact cost is measured as the\\ndifference in the market price of the security between two states of the\\nmarket:\\nState 1— the order was executed; execution was initiated at time t0,\\nand the execution was completed at time t1.\\nState 2—the order was not executed (the market was left undisturbed\\nby the order from t0 to t1).\\nIn real-life conditions, simultaneous observations of both the undis-\\nturbed market and the effects of the trade execution on the market are\\nhardly feasible, and the true value of the market impact may not be readily\\navailable. Instead, according to Kissell and Glantz (2003), the market im-\\npact is estimated as the difference between the market price att0 and the\\naverage execution price from t0 to t1:\\nMI = P0 − 1\\nN\\n∑\\nN\\nPτ,n (19.1)\\nwhere MI stands for “market impact,” P0 is the market price immediately\\nprior to execution at time t0, N is the total number of trades required to\\nprocess the entire position size from t0 to t1, and Pτ,n is the price at which\\nthe nth trade was executed at time τ, τ ∈ [t0,t1].\\nWhile the costs of market impact are difﬁcult to measure both pre-\\nand post-trade, market impact costs can be estimated as a percentage of\\nthe total market liquidity for a given security. The higher the percentage of\\nmarket liquidity the strategy consumes, the higher the adverse price move-\\nment following the trades, and the higher the market impact cost incurred\\nby subsequent trades in the same direction.\\nConsumed liquidity can be approximated as a percentage of the ob-\\nserved market volume that is directly due to market-order execution.

Limit orders, on the\\nother hand, supply liquidity, are executed only when “crossed” by a market\\norder, and generate little market impact at the time the order is executed.\\nLimit orders, however, may fail to execute and present a signiﬁcant risk in\\ncase the markets move adversely.\\nA combination of market and limit orders can help balance the costs\\nof market impact with the risks of non-execution. The optimal proportion\\nof market and limit orders may depend on the risk-aversion coefﬁcient of\\nthe trading strategy: Almgren and Chriss (1999), for example, specify the\\nmarket versus limit optimization problem as follows:\\nmin\\nα\\nMICost(α) + λRisk(α) (19.2)\\nwhere α is the trading rate calculated as a percentage of market volume due\\nto market orders placed by the strategy,λ is the coefﬁcient of risk aversion\\nof the strategy, and MICost stands for the market impact cost function.\\nAs usual, a risk aversion of 0.5 corresponds to a strategy for a conserva-\\ntive wealth-preserving investor, while a risk aversion of 0 corresponds to\\na risk-neutral strategy that is designed to maximize returns with little con-\\nsideration for risk. The optimization of equation (19.2) can be solved by\\nplotting MICost/Risk proﬁles for various strategies; the resulting efﬁcient\\ntrading frontier identiﬁes the best execution strategies.\\nAccording to Kissell and Malamut (2005), market impact costs can also\\nbe optimized using dynamic benchmarking, often referred to as “price-\\nscaling.” For example, a “strike” price–scaling strategy dictates that there\\nis an increase in the proportion of market orders whenever prices are bet-\\nter than the benchmark and a decrease in market orders whenever prices\\nare worse than the benchmark. A feasible alternative strategy, known as\\nthe “wealth” strategy, posts limit orders during favorable prices and mar-\\nket orders during adverse market conditions to minimize exposure to the\\nadverse changes in the traded security. A “plus” strategy maximizes the\\nprobability of outperforming a benchmark within a risk/return framework.\\nEach of the price-scaling strategies is discussed in detail in Chapter 18.\\nIn dark pools of liquidity and similar trading environments where the\\nextent of the order book cannot be observed directly, Kissell and Glantz\\n(2003) propose to estimate the cost of market impact using the following\\nexpression:\\nk(x) = I\\nX\\n∑\\nj\\nx2\\nj\\nxj + 0.5vj\\n(19.3)', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='27c3806c-bfed-4681-8545-f95d63c31cfb', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '307', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\nPost-Trade Proﬁtability Analysis 293\\nwhere I is the instantaneous market impact cost for security i, X is the or-\\nder size for security i, xj is the order size of the parcel of security i traded\\nat time j (assuming that the total order was broken down into smaller\\nparcels), and vj is the expected volume for security i at time j.

The inability to fulﬁll an order can be due to one of several factors:\\nr The market price never crossed the limit price.\\nr The market did not have the liquidity (demand or supply) sufﬁcient to\\nfulﬁll the order at the desired price.\\nr The price moved away so quickly that fulﬁlling the order would ren-\\nder the transaction unproﬁtable, and the transaction was canceled as\\na result.\\nr The opportunity cost is measured as the proﬁt expected to be gener-\\nated had the order been executed.\\nCost Variance Analysis\\nCost variance analysis summarizes deviations of realized costs from the\\ncost averages. The latest realized costs are compared against popula-\\ntion distributions of previously recorded costs with matching transaction\\nproperties—same ﬁnancial security, same strategy or portfolio manager,\\nand same executing broker.

Understanding the full cost proﬁle accompanying execution\\nof each security improves the ability to successfully model trading oppor-\\ntunities, leading to enhanced proﬁtability of trading strategies.\\nPOST-TRADE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\\nEfﬁcient Trading Frontier\\nTransaction costs may vary from strategy to strategy, portfolio manager to\\nportfolio manager, and executing broker to executing broker. Some strate-\\ngies may be designed to execute in calm market conditions when slippage\\nis minimal. Other strategies may work in volatile markets, when latency\\nimpact is palpable and makes up the bulk of transaction costs.\\nPerformance can be further compared to differentiate value added and\\nnon–value added execution. Almgren and Chriss (2000) propose that the\\nevaluation of execution be based on the “efﬁcient trading frontier” method-\\nology. Reminiscent of the efﬁcient frontier of Markowitz (1952) used in\\nportfolio optimization, the efﬁcient trading frontier (ETF) identiﬁes the\\nlowest execution cost per level of market risk at the time the order was\\nexecuted. The ETF is computed for each security, strategy, executing bro-\\nker, and cost type. Figure 19.1 illustrates this idea.\\nThe efﬁcient frontier is traced across all executed transactions in a\\ngiven security; it can be broken down by type of the transaction cost, strat-\\negy, executing broker, and so forth. The goal of the exercise is to use\\nexecution with the most optimal trading frontier going forward. Depend-\\ning on the scope of the analysis, the transaction cost can be measured as\\nthe implementation shortfall (IS) (discussed further along in this chapter)\\nor as an individual cost component as shown in Table 19.1.

A market price at the end of an intra-day trading period can be a\\npost-trading benchmark, as can be the daily close. Perold (1988) points out\\nthat to the extent that the trading system places trades correctly—buys\\na security that rises through the remainder of the trading period, for\\nexample—comparing execution price with the closing price for the trad-\\ning period will make execution look exceptionally, but unjustiﬁably,\\ngood.\\nIntra-trading benchmarks include various weighted price averages.\\nThe most popular benchmarks are the volume-weighted average price\\n(VWAP, pronounced “vee-wop”) and the time-weighted average price\\n(TWAP, pronounced “tee-wop”). Other benchmarks include averages of\\nthe open, high, low, and close prices (OHLC) within the given trading inter-\\nval that are designed to proxy for the intra-period range of price movement\\nand measure the algorithm’s capability to navigate volatility.\\nBoth the VWAP and the TWAP benchmarks can be based on daily,\\nhourly, or even higher-frequency price data surrounding the trade. The\\nVWAP for a particular securityi on day T is computed as follows:\\nVWAPi =\\n∑\\nt\\nvit pit\\n∑\\nt\\nvit\\n, {t}∈ T (19.5)\\nwhere vit is the volume of security i traded at time t, and pit is the market\\nprice of security i at time t.\\nVWAP is often thought to be a good indicator of market price through-\\nout the period under consideration (a minute, an hour, a day, etc.). Execu-\\ntion geared to outperform VWAP typically succeeds at minimizing market\\nimpact, and VWAP-based performance measures reﬂect the success of cost\\nminimization strategies. On the other hand, VWAP-based performance met-\\nrics do not assess the performance of strategies trying to minimize risk or\\nother variables other than market cost.\\nTWAP benchmarking measures the ability of the execution algorithm\\nto time the market. TWAP benchmark price computes the price that would\\nbe obtained if the order were split into equal-sized parcels and traded one\\nparcel at a time at equally spaced time intervals within the designated trad-\\ning time period:\\nTWAPi = 1\\nT\\nT∑\\nt=1\\npit, {t}∈ T (19.6)\\nwhere pit is the market price of security i at time t.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='90c241fd-698d-430b-afcf-bc108b929e4e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '312', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\n298 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nFinally, the OHLC benchmark is a simple average of the open, high,\\nlow, and close prices recorded during the trading period of interest:\\nOHLCi = 1\\n4\\n(\\npO\\nit + pH\\nit + pL\\nit + pC\\nit\\n)\\n, {t}∈ T (19.7)\\nwhere pO\\nit , pH\\nit , pL\\nit and pC\\nit are the market open, high, low, and close prices\\nof security i during the time interval t. The OHLC benchmark incorporates\\nthe intra-period price volatility by including the high and low price values.\\nThe OHLC benchmark does not, however, account for volume or liquidity\\navailable on the market.\\nKissell and Malamut (2005) point out that different investors may have\\nnatural preferences for different benchmarks. Value investors may want to\\nexecute at their decision price or better, mutual fund managers may need\\nto execute at the daily closing prices to facilitate the fund’s accounting,\\nand others may prefer VWAP, the below-average price for the pre-speciﬁed\\ntrading period. It is informative to compare performance of an algorithm\\nagainst all benchmarks.\\nOverall, Kissell and Glantz (2003) caution that the benchmarked eval-\\nuation of execution performance may not be thoroughly useful for the\\nfollowing reasons:\\n1. Benchmarked assessment does not lend itself to execution compar-\\nisons across asset classes, a comparison that may be desirable in as-\\nsessing performance of different executing brokers.\\n2. Benchmarked assessments are geared to minimization of execution\\nprices; other execution-related performance characteristics may be\\nplausible optimization candidates.\\n3. Furthermore, according to Kissell and Glantz (2003), benchmarked as-\\nsessment strategies can be manipulated to show better performance\\nthan is warranted by the actual execution, making the portfolio man-\\nager incur higher costs at the same time.\\nRelative Performance Measurement\\nTo address the ﬂaws of the benchmarked performance measurement,\\nKissell and Glantz (2003) propose “relative performance measurement” as\\nan alternative to the benchmarked analysis. The relative performance mea-\\nsure is based on either volume or the number of trades and determines the\\nproportion of volume or trades for which the market price throughout\\nthe trading time period (a minute, an hour, a day, etc.) was more favor-\\nable than the execution price. In other words, the relative performance\\nmeasure assesses at what percentage of volume or trades throughout the', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='865920d9-558b-4981-8cf2-c6f047d0e790', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '313', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\nPost-Trade Proﬁtability Analysis 299\\nspeciﬁed period of time the trade could have been executed on even bet-\\nter terms than it was actually executed. Speciﬁcally, relative performance\\nmeasure (RPM) is computed as follows:\\nRPM(volume) = Total volume | price better than execution price\\nTotal volume\\nRPM(trades) = Total # of trades | price better than execution price\\nTotal # of trades\\n(19.8)\\nAccording to Kissell and Glantz (2003), the relative performance mea-\\nsure allows a comparison of execution performance across different ﬁnan-\\ncial instruments as well as across time. Unlike the benchmarked approach\\nthat produces performance assessments in dollars and cents, the rela-\\ntive performance measure outputs results in percentages ready for cross-\\nsectional comparisons. For example, suppose we would like to compare\\nperformance of execution of two stocks, IBM and AAPL, within a given\\nhour. Suppose further that the benchmarked approach tells us that IBM\\noutperformed its VWAP by 0.04, whereas AAPL outperformed its VWAP by\\n0.01. The two measures are not comparable, as neither one takes into ac-\\ncount the relative prices of the securities traded. The relative performance\\nmeasure, on the other hand, produces the following numbers—50 percent\\nfor IBM and 5 percent for AAPL—and allows us to objectively deduce that\\nAAPL execution maximized its market advantage during the trading win-\\ndow, while execution of IBM can be improved further.\\nImplementation Shortfall\\nThe implementation shortfall (IS) measure due to Perold (1988) measures\\nthe efﬁciency of executing investment decisions. The IS is computed as the\\ndifference between the realized trades and the trades recorded in paper\\ntrading. The paper trading process usually runs in parallel with the live\\nprocess and records all the trades as if they were executed at desirable\\nprice at optimal times.\\nThe paper-trading system of Perold (1988) executes all trades at the\\nmid-point between the market bid and ask quotes, ignoring all transaction\\ncosts (spreads, commissions, etc.). The paper-trading system also assumes\\nthat unlimited volume can be processed at any point in time at the market\\nprice, ignoring the market depth or liquidity constraints and the associated\\nslippage and market impact. The IS metric then measures the cost of run-\\nning the trading system in real market conditions as compared to the costs\\nincurred in the idealized paper-trading environment.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b3c9c9b3-0fdf-4aba-bc86-5b619f3748e3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '314', 'file_name': 'High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\High-Frequency Trading- A Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems ( PDFDrive )_2.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2925041, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-29'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='P1: SBT\\nc19 JWBT188-Aldridge October 23, 2009 12:3 Printer: Yet to come\\n300 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nAs Perold (1988) notes, the observed IS can be due to several factors:\\nr Liquidity constraints\\nr Price movement due to information imputed in market prices\\nr Random price oscillations\\nr Latency in execution\\nr Market impact\\nr Commissions\\nr Fees\\nr Spreads\\nr Taxes\\nThe IS delivers a bundled estimate of the component costs and the esti-\\nmate is difﬁcult to disaggregate into individual cost centers. As a result, the\\nIS methodology of Perold (1988) has been subject to criticism. To measure\\nthe costs of execution with greater precision, Wagner and Banks (1992)\\nand Wagner and Edwards (1993) adjust IS by known transaction costs.\\nFurthermore, the implementation shortfall analysis can help in calcu-\\nlating the cost of market impact. A paper-trading system run concurrently\\nwith production can note two types of orders in parallel: (1) market orders\\nat the market prices when the order decisions are made and (2) limit or-\\nders when the market price crosses the limit price. Such analysis will help\\nassess the probability of hitting a limit order for a particular strategy, as\\nshown by equation (19.9):\\nPr(Limit Execution) = # of Executed Limit Orders\\n# of Orders Placed (19.9)\\nFor example, if out of 75 orders placed as limit orders, only 25 were exe-\\ncuted, the probability of executing a limit order for a given strategy is 33\\npercent.\\nThe analysis will also help describe the opportunity cost of missing\\nproﬁts for limit orders that are never hit, as shown in equation (19.10):\\nOpp Cost per Limit Order =−\\n∑ GainMarket Orders − ∑ GainLimit Orders\\n# of Orders Placed\\n(19.10)\\nBoth the probability and the opportunity costs accompanying limit or-\\nders are useful tools in designing and updating future trading systems.

As usual, the decision should be based on the\\nexpected gain of the limit order, computed as shown in equation (19.11):\\nE[GainLimit Orders] = (Opp Cost per Limit Order) ×\\nPr(Limit Execution) + (1 − Pr(Limit Execution)) ×\\n∑ GainLimit Orders\\n# of Executed Limit Orders (19.11)\\nAn order should be executed on limit instead of on market if the expected\\ngain associated with limit orders is positive.\\nFor example, suppose that a particular trading system on average ex-\\necutes two limit orders for every three limit orders placed. In this case,\\nPr(Lim itExecution) = 66.7 percent. In addition, suppose that every exe-\\ncuted limit order on average gains 15 bps and every executed market order\\ngains 12 bps. Then the opportunity cost on 100 orders placed can be com-\\nputed as follows:\\nOpp Cost per Limit Order =\\n−12 bps × 100 orders − 15 bps × 100 orders × 66.7%\\n100 orders =− 2 bps\\nE[GainLimit Orders] = (−2 bps) × 66.7% + (1 − 66.7%) × 15 bps = 3.67 bps\\nThe limit orders will continue being placed as limit orders (as opposed to\\nmarket orders) for as long as E[GainLimit Orders] remains positive.\\nPerformance Analysis Summary\\nBoth cost and performance analyses, performed post-trade, generate in-\\nsights critical to understanding the real-life trading behavior of trading\\nmodels.

\\nA Practical Guide\\nto Algorithmic Strategies and \\nTrading Systems\\nHIGH-\\nFREQUENCY\\nALDRIDGE \\nHIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING\\nA Practical Guide to Algorithmic Strategies and Trading Systems\\nFinancial markets are undergoing rapid innovation due \\nto the continuing proliferation of computer power and \\nalgorithms. These developments have created a new \\ninvestment discipline called high-frequency trading. \\nDespite the demand for information on this topic, \\nlittle has been published to help investors understand \\nand implement high-frequency trading systems—\\nuntil now.\\nWritten by industry expert Irene Aldridge, High-\\nFrequency Trading offers the ﬁ  rst applied “how to \\ndo it” manual to building high-frequency systems.\\nCovering sufﬁ  cient depths of material to thoroughly \\npinpoint issues at hand, High-Frequency Trading \\nleaves mathematical complexities to their original \\npublications, referenced throughout the book. \\nPage by page, this accessible guide:\\n\\x7f  Discusses the history and business environment of \\nhigh-frequency trading systems\\n\\x7f  Reviews the statistical and econometric foundations \\nof the common types of high-frequency strategies\\n\\x7f  Examines the details of modeling high-frequency \\ntrading strategies\\n\\x7f  Describes the steps required to build a quality high-\\nfrequency trading system\\n\\x7f  Addresses the issues of running, monitoring, and \\nbenchmarking high-frequency trading systems\\nAlong the way, this reliable resource skillfully high-\\nlights numerous quantitative trading strategies—\\nfrom market microstructure and event arbitrage to \\ndeviations arbitrage—and puts the creation and \\nmanagement of portfolios based on high-frequency \\nstrategies in perspective.\\nHigh-frequency trading is a difﬁ  cult, but proﬁ  table, \\nendeavor that can generate stable proﬁ  ts in various \\nmarket conditions. But solid footing in both the theory \\nand practice of this discipline are essential to success. \\nWhether you’re an institutional investor seeking a \\nbetter understanding of high-frequency operations or \\nan individual investor looking for a new way to trade, \\nthis book has what you need to make the most of your \\ntime in today’s dynamic markets.\\nIRENE ALDRIDGE is an \\nexpert on the subject of high-\\nfrequency trading. She is \\ncurrently a Managing Partner \\nand Quantitative Portfolio \\nManager at ABLE Alpha \\nTrading, LTD, a proprietary trading vehicle specializing \\nin high-frequency systematic trading strategies. Prior \\nto ABLE Alpha, Aldridge worked for various institutions \\non Wall Street and in Toronto, including Goldman Sachs \\nand CIBC. She also taught ﬁ  nance at the University \\nof Toronto. She holds an MBA from INSEAD, an MS in \\nﬁ  nancial engineering from Columbia University, and \\na BE in electric engineering from the Cooper Union in \\nNew York. Aldridge is a frequent speaker at top industry \\nevents and a contributor to academic and practitioner \\npublications, including the Journal of Trading, E-Forex, \\nHedgeWorld, FXWeek, FINalternatives, and Dealing \\nwith Technology .

Liquidity enables investors and issuers to meet their requirements regarding investment, \\nfinancing or hedging, reducing investment costs and the cost of capital. While developed markets maintain high \\nliquidity across products, many emerging markets  suffer significantly low levels, effectively placing a constraint on \\neconomic and market development.  \\nThe aim of this paper is to develop the machine learning models for liquidity prediction. The subject of research is \\nthe Vietnamese stock market, focusing on the recent years - from 2011 to 2019. Vietnamese stock market differs from \\ndeveloped markets and emerging markets. It is characterized by a limited number of transactions, which are also \\nrelatively small. Listed companies trade infrequently, and the trading volume is low. Vietnam has lower development \\nlevel comparing to the existing \"mainstream\" emerging markets but is developing fast last years. Therefore, analysis \\nof liquidity of Vietnamese stock market is justified and important. This research was conducted for two stock \\nexchanges in Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) and Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX). Liquidity prediction \\ncan be used for financial decision support, because the relationships between liquidity and share prices appear [5]. \\nMachine learning provides an automated technique of data analysis. Specifically, machine learning is defined as a \\nset of methods that enable to identify patterns in data, and then uncover patterns to predict the further data, or to support \\ndecision making under uncertainty [6], [7], [8]. This paper adopts the best way to predict the liquidity on a frontier \\nequity market is to use the machine learning. In machine learning technique, we generalize learning algorithms to learn \\nfrom data and perform a prediction.  \\nThe paper includes four sections. The related works are documented in the second section. The third section \\nprovides the description of materials and the research methodology. In the next section, we compare the different \\napproaches developed in this study. We discuss the main conclusions and the future work in the last section of the \\npaper. \\n \\n2.

Kong A., Zhu H., Azencott R. used liquidity measures and technical indicators \\nto predict intraday stock jumps. They used level-2-high-frequency data and divide trading day into a series of 5-minute \\nintervals to forecast whether a stock jump will occur in the next 5 minutes. They character ized ten types of liquidity \\nmeasures and eighteen types of technical indicators. The model is tested universally on the data of 1271 stocks in \\nChinese stock exchange.

Methods \\nThe research is based on three machine learning methods often used for financial time series prediction: two neural \\nnetworks models - Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and linear regression model, \\nMLP is a supplement of feed forward neural network. MLP consists of three layers [35]: \\n• input layer - receives the input signal to be processed \\n• hidden layer - computational engine of the MLP \\n• output layer - performs task for example prediction or classification \\nMLP can approximate any continuous function and solve not linearly separable problems. MLP is used as pattern \\nclassification, recognition, prediction and approximation. \\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is s an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in deep learning. \\nLSTM networks compensate the problem of vanishing gradients and short-term memory of traditional recurrent neural \\nnetwork. The architecture of LSTM are cell state (memory unit of the network) and its regulators. The cell state carries \\ninformation that can be stored in, written to, or read from a previous cell state via gates. LSTM is used in deep learning \\ntasks such as stock market prediction or handwriting and speech recognition [36].  \\nLinear regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.  It is mostly used for finding out \\nthe relationship between variables and forecasting.  Linear regression predicts a dependent variable value y based on \\na given independent variable x. Thus, linear regression finds out a linear relationship between x - input and y - output \\nthe regression line is the best fit line for a model [37]. \\n \\n4. Results \\nThe experiments aim to predict the AMIHUD measure on the basis of historical values of AMIHUD and SPRD, \\nRESPRD, VOL and TO measures. The one-day prediction is performed. We developed two neural networks model \\nbased on Multi-Layer Perceptron and Long Short-Term Memory. In addition, model based on regression has been \\ndeveloped. The developed models are based on related  works and our experience. The optimal structure of networks \\nwas determined based on experimental results.  \\nSeveral dozen experiments have been performed with different  parameters and hyper -parameters (e.g. type of \\nlayers, number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, batch size, and number of epochs). We use Keras \\nframework based on Tensorflow engine for neural networks models and sci-kit learn  library (link: https://scikit-\\nlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) for regression model. The Mean \\nSquare Error (MSE) has been used for model’s assessment.

The MAE values:  \\n• HOSE data: 0.0257 \\n• HNX data: 0.0215 \\nGenerally, the lowest value of MSE has been achieved using LSTM model. However, taking into consideration \\nthe HOSE data, the MSE achieved by LSTM is similar to MS E achieved by linear regression and value of MSE \\nachieved by MLP is lower than linear regression. It indicates the existence of mainly linear relationships between the \\nvariables. In case of HNX data both MLP and LSTM models have a lower value of MSE than a linear regression \\nmodel. Therefore, non-linear relationships between variables can appear. \\nConclusions \\nThe machine learning models allows for prediction the liquidity on Vietnamese stock market. On the basis of the \\nexperimental results, it can be concluded that the LSTM model allows for prediction characterized by lowest value of \\nMSE. The results of research  can be used for developing the methods for decision support on stock markets. On the \\nbasis of the liquidity prediction, the portfolio of financial instruments can be built. The main disadvantage of proposed \\napproach is the performing prediction only for o ne day. Therefore, future research works should be related to \\ndeveloping the model performin g prediction for week or month. In addition, models for other stock markets should \\nbe developed.  \\nAcknowledgements \\nThe project is financed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education in Poland under the programme \"Regional \\nInitiative of Excellence\" 2019 - 2022 project number 015/RID/2018/19 total funding amount 10 721 040,00 PLN. \\nReferences \\n[1] Amihud, Yakov, Hameed, Allaudeen, Kang, Wenjin, and Zhang, Huiping (2015) “The illiquidity premium: International evidence.” Journal of \\nFinancial Economics 117(2): 350-368. \\n[2] Haroon, Omair, and Rizvi, Syed Aun R.

Value\\nand momentum returns correlate more strongly across asset classes than passive\\nexposures to the asset classes, but value and momentum are negatively correlated\\nwith each other, both within and across asset classes. Our results indicate the pres-\\nence of common global risks that we characterize with a three-factor model. Global\\nfunding liquidity risk is a partial source of these patterns, which are identiﬁable only\\nwhen examining value and momentum jointly across markets. Our ﬁndings present\\na challenge to existing behavioral, institutional, and rational asset pricing theories\\nthat largely focus on U.S. equities.\\nTWO OF THE MOSTstudied capital market phenomena are the relation between\\nan asset’s return and the ratio of its “long-run” (or book) value relative to its\\ncurrent market value, termed the “value” effect, and the relation between an\\nasset’s return and its recent relative performance history, termed the “mo-\\nmentum” effect. The returns to value and momentum strategies have become\\ncentral to the market efﬁciency debate and the focal points of asset pricing stud-\\nies, generating numerous competing theories for their existence. We offer new\\ninsights into these two market anomalies by examining their returns jointly\\nacross eight diverse markets and asset classes. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant return pre-\\nmia to value and momentum in every asset class and strong comovement of\\ntheir returns across asset classes, both of which challenge existing theories for\\ntheir existence. We provide a simple three-factor model that captures the global\\nreturns across asset classes, the Fama–French U.S. stock portfolios, and a set\\nof hedge fund indices.\\n∗Asness is at AQR Capital Management; Moskowitz is at the University of Chicago Booth\\nSchool of Business and NBER and is a consultant to AQR Capital; and Pedersen is at the New\\nYork University Stern School of Business, Copenhagen Business School, AQR, CEPR, FRIC, and\\nNBER.

In the rare\\ncase in which value and momentum are studied outside of U.S. equities, they\\nare also typically studied in isolation—separate from each other and separate\\nfrom other markets. We uncover unique evidence and features of value and mo-\\nmentum by examining them jointly across eight different markets and asset\\nclasses (individual stocks in the United States, the United Kingdom, conti-\\nnental Europe, and Japan; country equity index futures; government bonds;\\ncurrencies; and commodity futures).1 Although some of these markets have\\nbeen analyzed in isolation, our joint approach provides unique evidence on\\nseveral key questions about these pervasive market phenomena. Speciﬁcally,\\nhow much variation exists in value and momentum premia across markets\\nand asset classes? How correlated are value and momentum returns across\\nthese diverse markets and asset classes with different geographies, structures,\\ninvestor types, and securities? What are the economic drivers of value and mo-\\nmentum premia and their correlation structure? What is a natural benchmark\\nmodel for portfolios of global securities across different asset classes?\\nWe ﬁnd consistent and ubiquitous evidence of value and momentum return\\npremia across all the markets we study, including value and momentum in\\ngovernment bonds and value effects in currencies and commodities, which are\\nall novel to the literature. Our broader set of portfolios generates much larger\\ncross-sectional dispersion in average returns than those from U.S. stocks only,\\nproviding a richer set of asset returns that any asset pricing model should\\nseek to explain. Most strikingly, we discover signiﬁcant comovement in value\\nand momentum strategies across diverse asset classes. Value strategies are\\npositively correlated with other value strategies across otherwise unrelated\\nmarkets, and momentum strategies are positively correlated with other mo-\\nmentum strategies globally. However, value and momentum are negatively\\ncorrelated with each other within and across asset classes.\\nThe striking comovement pattern across asset classes is one of our central\\nﬁndings and suggests the presence of common global factors related to value\\nand momentum. This common risk structure implies a set of results that we\\ninvestigate further. For example, using a simple three-factor model consisting\\nof a global market index, a zero-cost value strategy applied across all asset\\nclasses, and a zero-cost momentum strategy across all assets, we capture the\\ncomovement and the cross section of average returns both globally across asset\\nclasses and locally within an asset class. We further show that the global\\n1 Early evidence on U.S. equities ﬁnds that value stocks on average outperform growth stocks\\n(Stattman (1980), Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985), and Fama and French (1992)) and stocks\\nwith high positive momentum (high 6- to 12-month past returns) outperform stocks with low\\nmomentum (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Asness (1994)). Similar effects are found in other\\nequity markets (Fama and French (1998), Rouwenhorst (1998), Liew and Vassalou (2000), Grifﬁn,\\nJi, and Martin (2003), Chui, Wei, and Titman (2010)), and in country equity indices (Asness, Liew,\\nand Stevens (1997) and Bhojraj and Swaminathan (2006)). Momentum is also found in currencies\\n(Shleifer and Summers (1990), Kho (1996), LeBaron (1999)) and commodities (Erb and Harvey\\n(2006), Gorton, Hayashi, and Rouwenhorst (2008)).', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ba5cf7a1-14bf-4c87-aacc-61fa057047d3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '931', 'file_name': 'Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2101841, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-28'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='Value and Momentum Everywhere 931\\nthree-factor model does a good job capturing the returns to the Fama and\\nFrench U.S. stock portfolios as well as a set of hedge fund indices. Our use of\\na simple three-factor model in pricing a variety of assets globally is motivated\\nby ﬁnance research and practice becoming increasingly global and the desire\\nto have a single model that describes returns across asset classes rather than\\nspecialized models for each market. We show that separate factors for value\\nand momentum best explain the data, rather than a single factor, since both\\nstrategies produce positive returns on average yet are negatively correlated.2\\nWe then investigate the source of this common global factor structure. We ﬁnd\\nonly modest links to macroeconomic variables such as the business cycle, con-\\nsumption, and default risk. However, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant evidence that liquidity\\nrisk is negatively related to value and positively related to momentum globally\\nacross asset classes. P´astor and Stambaugh (2003) and Sadka (2006) ﬁnd that\\nmeasures of liquidity risk are positively related to momentum in U.S. individ-\\nual stocks. We show that this link is also present in other markets and asset\\nclasses, and that value returns are signiﬁcantly negatively related to liquidity\\nrisk globally, implying that part of the negative correlation between value and\\nmomentum is driven by opposite signed exposure to liquidity risk. Separating\\nmarket from funding liquidity (see Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)), we fur-\\nther ﬁnd that the primary link between value and momentum returns comes\\nfrom funding risk, whose importance has increased over time, particularly af-\\nter the funding crisis of 1998. Importantly, these results cannot be detected by\\nexamining a single market in isolation. The statistical power gained by looking\\nacross many markets at once—a unique feature of our analysis—allows these\\nfactor exposures to be revealed.\\nIn terms of economic magnitudes, however, liquidity risk can only explain a\\nsmall fraction of value and momentum return premia and comovement. While\\nliquidity risk may partly explain the positive risk premium associated with mo-\\nmentum, because value loads negatively on liquidity risk, the positive premium\\nassociated with value becomes an even deeper puzzle. Moreover, a simple equal-\\nweighted combination of value and momentum is immune to liquidity risk and\\ngenerates substantial abnormal returns. Hence, funding liquidity risk can only\\nprovide a partial and incomplete explanation for momentum, but cannot ex-\\nplain the value premium or the value and momentum combination premium.\\nThe evidence we uncover sheds light on explanations for the existence of\\nvalue and momentum premia. For example, a strong correlation structure\\namong these strategies in otherwise unrelated asset classes may indicate the\\npresence of common global risk factors for which value and momentum premia\\nprovide compensation. Conversely, such correlation structure is not a prediction\\nof existing behavioral models (e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam\\n(1998), Barberis, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), Hong and Stein (1999)).\\n2 A single factor would require signiﬁcant time variation in betas and/or risk premia to ac-\\ncommodate these facts.

These theories seem ill equipped\\nto explain the same and correlated effects we ﬁnd in currencies, government\\nbonds, and commodities.\\nWe also highlight that studying value and momentum jointly is more power-\\nful than examining each in isolation. The negative correlation between value\\nand momentum strategies and their high positive expected returns implies\\nthat a simple combination of the two is much closer to the efﬁcient frontier\\nthan either strategy alone, and exhibits less variation across markets and over\\ntime. The return premium to a combination of value and momentum applied\\nacross all asset classes therefore presents an even bigger challenge for asset\\npricing theories to accommodate (e.g., Hansen and Jagannathan (1997)).\\nOur work also relates to the recent literature on global asset pricing. Fama\\nand French (2012) examine the returns to size, value, and momentum in in-\\ndividual stocks across global equity markets and ﬁnd consistent risk premia\\nacross markets. Considering both global equities and other global asset classes,\\nFrazzini and Pedersen (2010) ﬁnd consistent returns to “betting against beta,”\\nKoijen et al. (2012) document global “carry” returns, and Moskowitz, Ooi, and\\nPedersen (2012) present global evidence of “time series momentum.” Time-\\nseries momentum is a timing strategy using each asset’s own past returns,\\nwhich is separate from the cross-sectional momentum strategies we study\\nhere. Focusing on this different time-series phenomenon, Moskowitz, Ooi, and\\nPedersen (2012) examine returns to futures contracts on equity indices, bonds,\\ncurrencies, and commodities—ignoring individual stocks, which comprise half\\nour study here—and address a different set of questions. Our focus is on the\\ninteraction between cross-sectional momentum and value strategies and their\\ncommon factor structure globally, where we ﬁnd striking comovement across\\nassets and a link to liquidity risk.\\nThe link to funding liquidity risk may also be consistent with global arbitrage\\nactivity in the face of funding constraints inﬂuencing value and momentum\\nreturns (Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009)). Why does momentum load posi-\\ntively on liquidity risk and value load negatively? A simple and natural story\\nmight be that momentum represents the most popular trades, as investors\\nchase returns and ﬂock to the assets whose prices appreciated most recently.\\nValue, on the other hand, represents a contrarian view.

Data on prices and\\nreturns come from Datastream, and data on book values are from Worldscope.\\nMost studies of individual stocks examine a much broader and less liquid set\\nof securities. We restrict our sample to a much more liquid universe (roughly the\\nlargest 20% of stocks in each market) to provide reasonable and conservative\\nestimates of an implementable set of trading strategies and to better compare\\nthose strategies with the set of strategies we employ in index futures, cur-\\nrencies, government bonds, and commodity futures, which are typically more\\nliquid instruments. Our results are conservative since value and momentum\\npremia are larger among smaller, less liquid securities over the sample period\\nwe study.5\\nAll series are monthly and end in July 2011. The U.S. and U.K. stock samples\\nbegin in January 1972. The Europe and Japan stock samples begin in January\\n1974.

All returns are denominated in U.S. dollars and do not\\ninclude the return on collateral associated with the futures contract.\\nB. Value and Momentum Measures\\nTo measure value and momentum, we use the simplest and, to the extent\\na standard exists, most standard measures. We are not interested in coming\\nup with the best predictors of returns in each asset class. Rather, our goal\\nis to maintain a simple and fairly uniform approach that is consistent across\\nasset classes and minimizes the pernicious effects of data snooping. As such,\\nif data snooping can be avoided, our results may therefore understate the true\\ngross returns to value and momentum available from more thoughtfully chosen\\nmeasures.\\nFor individual stocks, we use the common value signal of the ratio of the book\\nvalue of equity to market value of equity, or book-to-market ratio,BE/ME (see\\nFama and French (1992, 1993) and Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994)),\\nof the stock.7 Book values are lagged 6 months to ensure data availability to\\ninvestors at the time, and the most recent market values are used to compute\\nthe ratios. For the purposes of this paper, using lagged or contemporary prices\\nrather than market values matched contemporaneously in time as in Fama\\nand French (1992) is not important. When using more recent prices in the\\nvalue measure, the negative correlation between value and momentum is more\\nnegative and the value premium is slightly reduced, but our conclusions are not\\nmaterially affected. A combination of value and momentum—one of the themes\\nin this paper—obtains nearly identical pricing results regardless of whether\\nwe lag price in the value measure. Asness and Frazzini (2012) investigate\\nthis issue more thoroughly and argue that using contemporaneous market\\nvalues can be important and ease interpretation when examining value in the\\npresence of momentum, as we do in this paper. Gerakos and Linnainmaa (2012)\\ndecompose value into book and market components and ﬁnd that the market\\nvalue of equity drives most of the relevant pricing information.\\nFor momentum, we use the common measure of the past 12-month cumula-\\ntive raw return on the asset (see Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Asness (1994),\\nFama and French (1996), and Grinblatt and Moskowitz (2004)), skipping the\\nmost recent month’s return,MOM2–12. We skip the most recent month, which\\nis standard in the momentum literature, to avoid the 1-month reversal in stock\\nreturns, which may be related to liquidity or microstructure issues (Jegadeesh\\n(1990), Lo and MacKinaly (1990), Boudoukh, Richardson, and Whitelaw (1994),\\nAsness (1994), Grinblatt and Moskowitz (2004)).8\\n7 While research has shown that other value measures are more powerful for predicting stock\\nreturns (e.g., Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1994), Asness, Porter, and Stevens (2000), Piotroski\\n(2000)), we maintain a basic and simple approach that is somewhat consistent across asset classes.\\n8 Novy-Marx (2012) shows that the past 7- to 12-month return is a better momentum predictor\\nin U.S. stocks than the past 2- to 6-month return, though the past 2- to 6-month return is still a', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3fa45a63-20ba-4780-8992-bd5cbf190ede', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '937', 'file_name': 'Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2101841, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-28'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='Value and Momentum Everywhere 937\\nFor all other asset classes, we attempt to deﬁne similar value and momentum\\nmeasures. Momentum is straightforward since we can use the same measure\\nfor all asset classes, namely, the return over the past 12 months skipping the\\nmost recent month. While excluding the most recent month of returns is not\\nnecessary for some of the other asset classes we consider because they suffer\\nless from liquidity issues (e.g., equity index futures and currencies), we do so\\nto maintain uniformity across asset classes. Momentum returns for these asset\\nclasses are in fact stronger when we don’t skip the most recent month, hence\\nour results are conservative.\\nFor measures of value, attaining uniformity is more difﬁcult because not all\\nasset classes have a measure of book value. For these assets, we try to use sim-\\nple and consistent measures of value. For country indices, we use the previous\\nmonth’sBE/ME ratio for the MSCI index of the country. For commodities, we\\ndeﬁne value as the log of the spot price 5 years ago (actually, the average spot\\nprice from 4.5 to 5.5 years ago), divided by the most recent spot price, which\\nis essentially the negative of the spot return over the last 5 years. Similarly,\\nfor currencies, our value measure is the negative of the 5-year return on the\\nexchange rate, measured as the log of the average spot exchange rate from\\n4.5 to 5.5 years ago divided by the spot exchange rate today minus the log\\ndifference in the change in CPI in the foreign country relative to the U.S. over\\nthe same period. The currency value measure is therefore the 5-year change in\\npurchasing power parity. For bonds, we use the 5-year change in the yields of\\n10-year bonds as our value measure, which is similar to the negative of the past\\n5-year return. These long-term past return measures of value are motivated\\nby DeBondt and Thaler (1985), who use similar measures for individual stocks\\nto identify “cheap” and “expensive” ﬁrms. Fama and French (1996) show that\\nthe negative of the past 5-year return generates portfolios that are highly cor-\\nrelated with portfolios formed onBE/ME, and Gerakos and Linnainmaa (2012)\\ndocument a direct link between past returns andBE/ME ratios. Theory also\\nsuggests a link between long-term returns and book-to-market value measures\\n(e.g., Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998), Barberis, Shleifer, and\\nVishny (1998), Hong and Stein (1999), and Vayanos and Wooley (2012)).\\nIn the Internet Appendix accompanying this paper, we show that individual\\nstock portfolios formed from the negative of past 5-year returns are highly\\ncorrelated with those formed onBE/ME ratios in our sample.9 For example,\\npositive predictor. We use the more standard momentum measure based on the past 2- to 12-month\\nreturn for several reasons. First, as Novy-Marx (2012) shows, the beneﬁt of using returns from\\nthe past 7- to 12-months as opposed to the entire 2- to 12-month past return is negligible in U.S.\\nstocks. Second, Goyal and Wahal (2012) examine the power of past 7- to 12-month versus past 2- to\\n6-month returns across 36 countries and ﬁnd that there is no signiﬁcant difference between these\\npast return predictors in 35 out of 36 countries—the exception being the United States. Third,\\nMOM2–12 is the established momentum signal that has worked well out of sample over time and\\nacross geography. While we believe usingMOM2–12 is the most prudent and reasonable measure\\nto use for these reasons, using other momentum signals, such asMOM7–12, should not alter any\\nof our conclusions.\\n9 An Internet Appendix may be found in the online version of this article.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a8c73dcd-1d34-4537-ae4b-67ec4c7f44d6', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '938', 'file_name': 'Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2101841, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-28'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='938 The Journal of Finance R⃝\\namong U.S. stocks the correlation between returns to a value factor formed from\\nthe negative of the past 5-year return and the returns formed fromBE/ME sorts\\nis 0.83.

Globally, a value factor averaged across all four stock markets\\nestimated from negative past 5-year return sorts has a correlation of 0.86 with\\na value factor formed fromBE/ME sorts. Hence, using past 5-year returns to\\nmeasure value seems reasonable.\\nC. Value and Momentum Portfolios: 48 New Test Assets\\nUsing the measures above, we construct a set of value and momentum portfo-\\nlios within each market and asset class by ranking securities within each asset\\nclass by value or momentum and sorting them into three equal groups. We\\nthen form three portfolios—high, middle, and low—from these groups, where\\nfor individual stocks we value weight the returns in the portfolios by their\\nbeginning-of-month market capitalization, and for the nonstock asset classes\\nwe equal weight securities.10 Given that our sample of stocks focuses exclu-\\nsively on very large and liquid securities in each market, typically the largest\\nquintile of securities, further value weighting the securities within this uni-\\nverse creates an extremely large and liquid set of portfolios that should yield\\nvery conservative results compared to typical portfolios used in the literature.\\nThus, we generate three portfolios—low, middle, and high—for each of the\\ntwo characteristics—value and momentum—in each of the eight asset classes,\\nproducing 3× 2 × 8 = 48 test portfolios.\\nD. Value and Momentum Factors\\nWe also construct value and momentum factors for each asset class, which\\nare zero-cost long-short portfolios that use the entire cross section of securi-\\nties within an asset class. For any securityi = 1 ,..., N at time t with signal\\nSit (value or momentum), we weight securities in proportion to their cross-\\nsectional rank based on the signal minus the cross-sectional average rank of\\nthat signal. Simply using ranks of the signals as portfolio weights helps miti-\\ngate the inﬂuence of outliers, but portfolios constructed using the raw signals\\nare similar and generate slightly better performance. Speciﬁcally, the weight\\non securityi at timet is\\nwS\\nit = ct(rank(Sit) − /Sigma1irank(Sit)/N), (1)\\nwhere the weights across all stocks sum to zero, representing a dollar-neutral\\nlong-short portfolio. We include a scaling factorct such that the overall portfolio\\nis scaled to one dollar long and one dollar short.

As we will\\nshow, the signal-weighted factor portfolios outperform simple portfolio sort\\nspreads because security weights are a positive (linear) function of the signal,\\nas opposed to the coarseness of only classifying securities into three groups.\\nIn addition, the factors are better diversiﬁed since more securities in the cross\\nsection are given nonzero weight and the weights are less extreme.\\nII.

zero-cost spread portfolio and the zero-cost signal-weighted factor\\nreturns.\\nPanel A of TableI reports results for each of the individual stock strategies.\\nConsistent with results in the literature, there is a signiﬁcant return premium\\nfor value in every stock market, with the strongest performance in Japan. Mo-\\nmentum premia are also positive in every market, especially in Europe, but are\\nstatistically insigniﬁcant in Japan. As the last row for each market indicates,\\nthe correlation between value and momentum returns is strongly negative,\\naveraging about –0.60. Combining two positive return strategies with such\\nstrong negative correlation to each other increases Sharpe ratios signiﬁcantly.\\nIn every market, the value/momentum combination outperforms either value\\nor momentum by itself. Hence, many theories attempting to explain the ob-\\nserved Sharpe ratio for value or momentum have a higher hurdle to meet if\\nconsidering a simple linear combination of the two.\\nIn addition, the combination of value and momentum is much more stable\\nacross markets. For instance, previous research attempting to explain why\\nmomentum does not work very well in Japan (see Chui, Titman, and Wei (2010)\\nfor a behavioral explanation related to cultural biases) needs to confront the\\nfact that value has performed exceptionally well in Japan during the same time\\nperiod, as well as the fact that the correlation between value and momentum\\nin Japan is –0.64 over this period. So, rather than explain why momentum\\ndid not work in Japan, it would be nearly equally appropriate to ask why\\nvalue did so well (see Asness (2011)). Moreover, an equal combination of value\\nand momentum in Japan realizes an even higher Sharpe ratio than value alone\\nsuggesting that a positive weight on momentum in Japan improves the efﬁcient\\nfrontier, which is also conﬁrmed from a static portfolio optimization.\\nThe last set of rows of TableI, Panel A show the power of combining value\\nand momentum portfolios across markets. We report an average of value, mo-\\nmentum, and their combination across all four regions (“Global stocks”) by\\nweighting each market by the inverse of their ex post sample standard devia-\\ntion.11 Value applied globally generates an annualized Sharpe ratio not much\\nlarger than the average of the Sharpe ratios across each market, indicating\\nstrong covariation among value strategies across markets. Likewise, momen-\\ntum applied globally does not produce a Sharpe ratio much larger than the\\n11 We compute the monthly standard deviation of returns for each passive benchmark in each\\nmarket and weight each market by the inverse of this number, rescaled to sum to one, to form\\na global portfolio across all markets. Each market’s dollar contribution to the global portfolio is\\ntherefore proportional to the reciprocal of its measured volatility, but each market contributes\\nan equal fraction to the total volatility of the portfolio, ignoring correlations.

We also examine a diversiﬁed port-\\nfolio of value, momentum, and their combination across all asset classes. Since\\nthe volatilities of the portfolios are vastly different across asset classes—for\\nexample, commodity strategies have about four times the volatility of bond\\nstrategies—we weight each asset class by the inverse of its ex post sample\\nvolatility, so that each asset class contributes roughly an equal amount to the\\nex post volatility of the diversiﬁed portfolio.13 The diversiﬁed portfolio across all\\nasset classes yields small improvements in Sharpe ratios, which suggests the\\npresence of correlation structure in value and momentum returns across these\\ndifferent asset classes. Models that give rise to value and momentum returns in\\nequities, such as the production- or investment-based theories of Berk, Green,\\nand Naik (1999), Johnson (2002), Gomes, Kogan, and Zhang (2003), Zhang\\n(2005), Sagi and Seasholes (2007), Liu, Whited, and Zhang (2009), Li, Livdan,\\nand Zhang (2009), Belo (2010), Li and Zhang (2010), and Liu and Zhang (2008),\\nmay not easily apply to other asset classes, yet we ﬁnd similar value and mo-\\nmentum effects that are correlated to those found in equities, suggesting at\\nleast part of these premia are not captured by these models. Likewise, theories\\nof investor behavior, which largely rely on individual investors in equities, will\\nalso have difﬁculty accommodating these facts.\\nCombining the stock (Panel A) and nonstock (Panel B) value and momen-\\ntum strategies across all asset classes produces even larger Sharpe ratios. We\\ncombine the global stock strategies with the global nonstock other asset class\\nstrategies by weighting each by the inverse of their in-sample volatility, where\\nwe weight the average stock strategy by its volatility and the average non-\\nstock strategy by its volatility, rather than weighting each individual market\\nor asset class by its own volatility. The 50/50 value and momentum combina-\\ntion portfolio produces an annual Sharpe ratio of 1.45, which presents an even\\ngreater challenge for asset pricing models that already struggle to explain the\\nmagnitude of the U.S. equity premium, which is about one third as large. Con-\\nsidering value and momentum together and applying them globally across all\\nasset classes, the Sharpe ratio hurdle that these pricing models need to explain\\nis several times larger than those found in U.S. equity data alone.\\n12 The somewhat weaker returns for the nonstock asset classes would be partially attenuated\\nif transactions costs were considered, since trading costs are typically higher for individual stocks\\nthan the futures contracts we examine outside of equities. Therefore, net-of-trading-cost returns\\nwould elevate the relative importance of the nonstock strategies.

Alternative Measures\\nWe use a single measure for value and a single measure for momentum for\\nall eight markets we study. We choose the most studied or simplest measure in\\neach case and attempt to maintain uniformity across asset classes to minimize\\nthe potential for data mining. Using these simple, uniform measures results\\nin positive risk premia for value and momentum in every asset class we study,\\nthough some of the results are statistically insigniﬁcant. In particular, our\\nweakest results pertain to bonds, which do not produce statistically reliable\\npremia. However, data mining worries may be weighed against the potential\\nimprovements from having better measures of value and momentum. For ex-\\nample, value strategies among bonds can be markedly improved with more\\nthoughtful measures. Using our current measure of value, the 5-year change\\nin yields of 10-year maturity bonds, we are only able to produce a Sharpe ratio\\nof 0.18 and an alpha of 1.9% that is not statistically signiﬁcant (t-statistic of\\n1.68). However, Panel C of TableI reports results for value strategies among\\nbonds that use alternative measures, such as the real bond yield, which is the\\nyield on 10-year bonds minus the 5-year forecast in inﬂation, and the term\\nspread, which is the yield on 10-year bonds minus the short rate. As Panel C of\\nTable I shows, these alternative value measures produce Sharpe ratios of 0.73\\nand 0.55, respectively, and thet-statistics of their alphas are signiﬁcant at 2.36\\nand 2.78.\\nMoreover, we are able to produce even more reliable risk premia when using\\nmultiple measures of value simultaneously that diversify away measurement\\nerror and noise across the variables.14 Creating a composite average index of\\nvalue measures using all three measures above produces even stronger results,\\nwhere value strategies generate Sharpe ratios of 0.91 and 1.10 witht-statistics\\non their alphas of 4.40 and 5.48. These alternative measures of value also blend\\nnicely with our original measure for momentum, where, in each case, the 50/50\\nvalue/momentum combination portfolios also improve with these alternative\\nmeasures.\\nHence, our use of single, simple, and uniform value and momentum mea-\\nsures may understate the true returns to these strategies in each asset class.\\nNevertheless, we stick with these simple measures to be conservative and to\\nmitigate data mining concerns, even though, in the case of bonds, the results\\nappear to be insigniﬁcant with such simple measures.\\nC.

We do the\\nsame for momentum. We then compute the correlation matrix between these\\naverage return series. The diagonal of the correlation matrix is computed as\\nthe average correlation between each individual market’s return series and\\nthe average of allother return series in other markets. For instance, the ﬁrst\\nentry in the covariance matrix is the average of the correlations between each\\nequity market’s value strategy and a portfolio of all other equity market value\\nstrategies: an average of the correlation of U.S. value with a diversiﬁed value\\nstrategy in all other individual equity markets (United Kingdom, Europe, and\\nJapan); the correlation of U.K. value with a diversiﬁed value strategy in the\\nUnited States, Europe, and Japan; the correlation of Europe value with a diver-\\nsiﬁed value strategy in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan; and\\nthe correlation of Japan value with a diversiﬁed value strategy in the United\\nStates, United Kingdom, and Europe. We then take an equal weighted average\\nof these four correlations to get the ﬁrst element of the correlation matrix in\\nPanel A of Table II.

The average individual stock momentum\\nstrategy has a correlation of 0.65 with the average momentum strategy in other\\nstock markets and a correlation of 0.37 with the average nonstock momentum\\nstrategy. The strong correlation structure among value and momentum strate-\\ngies across such different assets is interesting since these asset classes have\\ndifferent types of investors, institutional and market structures, and informa-\\ntion environments.\\nValue and momentum are also negatively correlated across asset classes.\\nThe correlation between a value strategy in one stock market and a portfolio\\nof momentum strategies in other stock markets is –0.53.

This correlation structure—value being positively\\ncorrelated across assets, momentum being positively correlated across assets,\\nand value and momentum being negatively correlated within and across asset\\nclasses—cannot be explained by the correlation of passive exposure to the\\nasset classes themselves.

However, lagging prices by 1 year in theBE/ME measure\\n(i.e., using ME from 1 year prior) so that the value measure uses price data\\nthat do not overlap with the momentum measure, still produces a negative\\ncorrelation between value and momentum of –0.28, which is highlighted in the\\nInternet Appendix.

This provides more\\nevidence that past 5-year returns capture similar effects asBE/ME (Gerakos\\nand Linnainmaa (2012) reach a similar conclusion).

Liquidity Risk Exposure\\nTable IV reports results from regressions that add various liquidity risk\\nproxies to the macroeconomic variables above.\\nB.1. Measuring Funding and Market Liquidity Risk\\nTo measure liquidity risk exposure, we regress value and momentum returns\\non shocks to liquidity. We follow Moskowitz and Pedersen (2012) to deﬁne our\\nliquidity shocks. We consider both funding liquidity shocks (e.g., Brunnermeier\\nand Pedersen (2009)) and market liquidity shocks. The funding liquidity vari-\\nables are the Treasury-Eurodollar (TED) spread (the average over the month of\\nthe daily local 3-month interbank LIBOR interest rate minus the local 3-month\\ngovernment rate), the LIBOR minus term repo spread (the spread between the\\nlocal 3-month LIBOR rate and the local term repurchase rate), and the spread\\nbetween interest rate swaps and local short-term government rates (Swap-T-\\nbill) in each of the four markets. We sign every variable so that it represents\\nliquidity. Hence, we take the negative of the TED spread and the other spreads\\nso that they capture liquidity, since a wider spread represents worse liquidity.\\nThe funding series are available for the common period January 1987 to July\\n2011. We deﬁne shocks to these variables as the residuals from an AR(2) model,\\nfollowing Korajczyk and Sadka (2008) and Moskowitz and Pedersen (2012).17\\nThe market liquidity variables are the on-the-run minus off-the-run 10-year\\ngovernment Treasury note spread (see Krishnamurthy (2002)) in each of the\\nfour markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Europe, us-\\ning Germany as a proxy); the P´astor and Stambaugh (2003) liquidity measure\\n(their factor, not their factor mimicking portfolio; speciﬁcally, their innovations\\nobtained from CRSP); and the illiquidity measure of Acharya and Pedersen\\n(2005), motivated by Amihud’s (2002) measure. We construct the P´astor and\\nStambaugh (2003) and Acharya and Pedersen (2005) measures in other coun-\\ntries by following their methodologies applied to stocks in those markets. Once\\nagain, these variables are signed so that they representliquidity, and hence\\nwe take the negative of the Acharya and Pedersen (2005) measure, which is\\nbased on Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity measure.\\nIn addition, we take the ﬁrst principal component of the correlation matrix\\nof all funding liquidity shocks, all market liquidity shocks, and all liquidity\\nshocks and construct an index of shocks for funding, market, and all liquidity.18\\nThe principal component of the correlation, rather than covariance, matrix is\\n17 There is no special or theoretical reason to use an AR(2).

The liquidity shocks are estimated as residuals from an AR(2) of\\na set of funding liquidity variables and market liquidity variables. The funding liquidity variables\\nare the Treasury-Eurodollar (TED) spread, the LIBOR minus term repo spread, and the interest\\nrate swap minus T-bill spread. We also compute a principal component weighted average index of\\nthe funding liquidity shocks (“Funding liquidity PC”) from the correlation matrix of the liquidity\\nshocks and use this as another regressor. The market liquidity variables are the on-the-run minus\\noff-the-run 10-year government Treasury note spread, the P´astor and Stambaugh (2003)l i q u i d i t y\\nmeasure, and the illiquidity measure of Acharya and Pedersen (2005). All variables are signed so\\nthat they represent liquidity, and hence we take the negative of the Acharya and Pedersen (2005)\\nmeasure. A principal component-weighted average index of the market liquidity shocks from the\\ncorrelation matrix of the liquidity shocks is also used. Finally, we use a principal component-\\nweighted average index of all liquidity shocks (funding and market) from the correlation matrix of\\nthose liquidity shocks as a regressor, where every variable is signed to represent liquidity. Panel A\\nreports results using only U.S. liquidity risk variables and Panel B reports results using global\\nliquidity risk measures, where the global liquidity risks are estimated by taking the average of\\nall the liquidity measures across countries—the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and\\nJapan—weighted by the principal component of each country’s contribution to the correlation ma-\\ntrix of each liquidity measure across the four markets. TED spreads, LIBOR—term repo rates,\\nswap—T-bill rates, and on-the-run minus off-the-run spreads for each country are quoted using\\neach country’s government bond rates. The P´astor and Stambaugh (2003) and Acharya and Ped-\\nersen (2005) measures are computed outside of the United States following the same methodology\\noutlined in those papers to individual stocks in each of the other markets—the United Kingdom,\\nEurope, and Japan.

Time series of global liquidity shocks.The time series of global liquidity shocks is\\nplotted from January 1987 to June 2010, where global liquidity shocks are as deﬁned in Section\\nIII. Global liquidity shocks are the residuals from an AR(2) of the global liquidity index, which\\nis a principal component weighted average of all market and funding liquidity variables across\\nall markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan) as described in Section\\nIII.

The ﬁrst four\\nrows of Panel A of TableIV show that funding liquidity risk is consistently\\nnegatively related to value returns and signiﬁcantly positively related to mo-\\nmentum returns. Value performs poorly when funding liquidity rises, which\\noccurs during times when borrowing is easier, while momentum performs well\\nduring these times. The opposite exposure to funding liquidity shocks for value\\nand momentum contributes partly to their negative correlation.19\\nThe next four rows examine market liquidity shocks in the U.S. market.

So, in addition to funding liquidity being tight when spreads are wide, it may also\\nbe the case that risk aversion or risk premia in the economy are particularly high. Under this\\nalternative view, however, it would seem thatboth value and momentum returns would decline\\nwith rising spreads, whereas we ﬁnd that value and momentum returns move in opposite directions\\nwith respect to these shocks.

We ﬁnd the same sign as P´astor and Stambaugh (2003) for our\\nglobal momentum returns across asset classes over our sample period, but do\\nnot detect a signiﬁcant relation. In addition to our momentum returns covering\\na wider set of asset classes and a different time period from P´astor and Stam-\\nbaugh (2003), we also use their factor andnot their factor mimicking portfolio.\\nThey show that the latter exhibits a much stronger relation to momentum,\\nwhile the former exhibits a weak relation to momentum, consistent with our\\nglobal results.\\nPanel B of TableIV reports the regression results using the global fund-\\ning and market liquidity shocks. Global funding liquidity shocks negatively\\nimpact value returns and positively affect momentum returns, but global mar-\\nket liquidity shocks do not seem to have much impact, consistent with the U.S.\\nliquidity measures. Furthermore, the global measures, especially the fund-\\ning liquidity index, seem to provide more statistical signiﬁcance. The opposite\\nsigned loadings on liquidity risk for value and momentum may partially explain\\nwhy the two strategies are negatively correlated.\\nHowever, the opposite signed loadings on a single factor, such as liquidity\\nrisk, cannot explain whyboth value and momentum earn positive risk pre-\\nmia. On the one hand, part of the returns to momentum can be explained as\\ncompensation for liquidity risk exposure since momentum loads positively on\\nliquidity shocks and liquidity risk carries a positive risk premium. On the other\\nhand, value loads negatively on liquidity risk, which makes its positive return\\nan even deeper puzzle.\\nWhy does momentum load positively and value load negatively on liquidity\\nrisk? One simple and intuitive story might be that momentum captures the\\nmost popular trades, being long the assets whose prices have recently appre-\\nciated as ﬁckle investors ﬂocked to these assets. Value, on the other hand,\\nexpresses a contrarian view, where assets have experienced price declines over\\nseveral years. When a liquidity shock occurs, investor liquidations (from cash\\nneeds, redemptions, risk management, “running for the exit” at the same time;\\nsee Pedersen (2009)) puts more price pressure on the more “crowded” trades.\\nThese liquidations may affect crowded high momentum securities more than\\nthe less popular contrarian/value securities. Further investigation into the\\nopposite signed exposure of value and momentum to liquidity risk is an inter-\\nesting research question, but beyond the scope of this paper.\\nFinally, as TableIV shows, because of the opposite signed exposure of value\\nand momentum to funding liquidity shocks, the 50/50 equal combination of\\nvalue and momentum is essentially immune to funding shocks, and yet, as we\\nhave shown, generates huge positive returns. Thus, while exploring liquidity\\nrisk’s relation to value and momentum more deeply may be interesting, liquid-\\nity risk by itself cannot explain why a combination of value and momentum is', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a7da60fb-c902-43a2-9193-1f3d66b4c256', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '963', 'file_name': 'Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2101841, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-28'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='Value and Momentum Everywhere 963\\n-0.95\\n-3.25\\n1.81\\n4.43\\n-4\\n-3\\n-2\\n-1\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5t-sta/g415s/g415cs on liquidity risk beta\\nValue Momentum\\nt-stat of the \\naverage \\nreturn series\\naverage of \\nindividual \\nt-stats\\nFigure 4.

The Power of Averaging Across Markets\\nA key feature of the analysis in TablesIII and IV is that we examine the\\naverage returns to value and momentum across a wide set of markets and asset\\nclasses simultaneously. The power of looking at the universal average return\\nto value and momentum greatly improves our ability to identify common factor\\nexposure. For example, if we examine each individual value and momentum\\nstrategy’s exposure to liquidity risk separately, we do not ﬁnd nearly as strong\\na pattern and, in fact, might conclude there exists little evidence of any reliable\\nrelation to liquidity risk.\\nFigure 4 depicts thet-statistics of the liquidity betas of each of our individual\\nmarket and asset class value and momentum strategies. The averaget-statistic\\nof the liquidity betas for value is –0.95 and for momentum is 1.81—hardly con-\\nvincing. In contrast, when we regress the average value and momentum return\\nseries across all markets and asset classes on global liquidity shocks, we get a\\nt-statistic for the liquidity beta of –3.25 for value and 4.43 for momentum.

Explaining Value/Momentum in One Market with Value/Momentum in\\nOther Markets\\nWe ﬁrst examine how well value and momentum in one market or asset class\\nare explained by value and momentum returns in other asset classes. This test\\nis not a formal asset pricing test, but a test of comovement across markets and\\nasset classes. In the next subsection, we examine formal asset pricing tests.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we run the regression\\nRp\\ni,t − rf ,t = αp\\ni + βp\\ni MKTt + vp\\ni\\n∑\\nj̸=i\\nwjVALj,t + mp\\ni\\n∑\\nj̸=i\\nwjMOM j,t + εp\\ni,t, (4)\\nwhere Rp\\ni,t is the timet return to portfoliop among the six high, middle, and\\nlow value and momentum portfolios in one of the eight asset marketsi,f o ra\\ntotal of 48 test assets. The time series of excess returns (in excess of the U.S.\\nT-bill rate) of each portfolio is regressed on the excess returns of the market\\nportfolio MKT (proxied by the MSCI World Index) and the returns to value\\nand momentum factors inall other markets and asset classes. The latter two\\nvariables are constructed as the equal volatility-weighted average of the zero-\\ncost signal-weighted value and momentum factors in all other markets (where\\nwj represents the equal volatility weight for each asset class), excluding the\\nmarket whose test assets are being used as the dependent variable.\\nWe estimate equation(4) for each market and asset class separately. Figure\\n5 plots the actual average return of each of the test assets against the predicted\\nexpected return from the regression.

Speciﬁcally, for each of the eight markets we\\nconsider (U.S. stocks, U.K. stocks, Europe stocks, Japan stocks, country index futures, currencies,\\ngovernment bonds, commodities) we estimate the betas of value and momentum low, middle, and\\nhigh portfolios in each market with respect to a value and momentum factor across all other\\nmarkets by running a time-series regression of each value and momentum portfolio in one market\\non the (equal volatility-weighted) average of the value and momentum factors across all other\\nmarkets, excluding the market being analyzed. The predicted value from this regression is the\\npredicted expected return of the strategy that we plot against the average actual average return\\nover the sample period. The average absolute value of the alphas from these regressions and the\\ncross-sectional R2 of the actual average returns against the predicted expected returns are also\\nreported. To highlight both the alphas and cross-sectional ﬁt, a 45◦ line is plotted through the\\norigin.\\nAs Figure5 shows, the average returns line up well with the predicted expected\\nreturns. The cross-sectionalR2 is 0.55 and the average absolute value of the\\npricing errors (alpha) is 22.6 basis points per month.

Hence, the\\nevidence in Figure5 makes a compelling case for common global factor struc-\\nture in value and momentum returns and suggests that this common variation\\nis economically meaningful since it captures a signiﬁcant fraction of the cross\\nsection of average returns.\\nB. A Global Three-Factor Model\\nTo conduct a more formal asset pricing test, and to compare across various\\nasset pricing models, we construct a three-factor model similar to equation(4),\\nbut where the regressors are the same for every asset. This three-factor model\\nis similar in spirit to those of Fama and French (1993) and Carhart (1997),\\nbut applied globally to all markets and asset classes we study. Speciﬁcally, we\\nestimate the following time-series regression for each of the 48 high, middle,\\nand low value and momentum portfolios across asset classes:\\nRp\\ni,t − rf ,t = αp\\ni + βp\\ni MKTt + vp\\ni VALeverywhere\\nt + mp\\ni MOMeverywhere\\nt + εp\\ni,t, (5)\\nwhere VALeverywhere\\nt and MOMeverywhere\\nt are the equal-volatility-weighted across-\\nasset-class value and momentum factors.\\nThe ﬁrst graph in Panel A of Figure6 plots the actual sample average returns\\nof the 48 test assets versus their predicted expected returns from equation(5)\\nalong with a 45◦ line through the origin to highlight the magnitude of the\\npricing errors. The cross-sectionalR2 is 0.71 and the average absolute value\\nof the alpha is 18 basis points, indicating slightly better ﬁt than equation(4),\\nwhich is not surprising, since, unlike equation(4), equation(5) contains some of\\nthe same securities on the left- and right-hand side of the regression. However,\\nthe ﬁt is similar to equation(4), and equation(5) also allows for a formal joint\\ntest of the signiﬁcance of the alphas, since the explanatory variables are the\\nsame for each test asset. Hence, we report the Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken\\n(GRS, 1989) F-statistic andp-value for a joint test of the pricing errors.\\nThe remaining graphs in Panel A of Figure6 plot the pricing errors of the\\n48 test assets under alternative asset pricing models: the global CAPM, using\\nthe MSCI World Index as the market proxy; a four-factor model inspired by\\nCarhart (1997), which is the Fama–French three-factor model consisting of\\nthe U.S. stock marketRMRF, the U.S. size factorSMB, and the U.S. value\\nfactor HML augmented with the U.S. stock momentum factorUMD obtained\\nfrom Ken French’s website, that we refer to as the “Fama–French four-factor\\nmodel”; and a six-factor model that adds the Fama and French (1993) bond\\nreturn factorsDEF and TERM, which capture the default and term spread for\\nU.S. bonds, that we refer to as the “Fama–French six-factor model.” As Figure\\n6 shows, the global CAPM does not do a very good job ﬁtting the cross section of\\nvalue and momentum returns across markets and asset classes, producing the\\nlargest absolute pricing errors and smallestR2. The Fama–French four- and\\nsix-factor speciﬁcations explain the returns a little better than the CAPM, but\\nnot nearly as well as the global three-factor model.

Here, we use the Fama–French 25 size-value and 25 size-\\nmomentum portfolios from Ken French’s website (http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.\\nedu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data library.html) as test assets. These are, re-\\nspectively, 5×5 double-sorted portfolios of U.S. stocks based on size andBE/ME\\nand 5×5 portfolios sorted on size and past 2- to 12-month returns. Our three-\\nfactor model derived from other markets and asset classes does a reasonable\\njob explaining the returns to these 50 U.S. equity portfolios. The cross-sectional\\nR2 is 0.64 and the average absolute pricing error is only 18 basis points. While\\nthe Fama–French factors, which are derived from the same U.S. stocks as the\\ntest assets, obviously do slightly better, our three-factor model, which is derived\\nfrom other asset classes, captures a signiﬁcant fraction of the cross-sectional\\nvariation in U.S. equity returns. In addition, our three-factor model does not\\ncontain a size factor, which is important for pricing the Fama-French U.S. stock\\nportfolios. If we exclude the two smallest quintiles of stocks from the Fama-\\nFrench portfolios, then our three-factor model does as well as the Fama-French\\nmodel in pricing the remaining Fama-French U.S. portfolios.\\nTaken together, Panel A of Figure6 shows that our global three-factor model\\ncan explain the returns to value and momentum across markets and asset\\nclasses much better than local U.S. factors can and Panel B shows that our\\nglobal factors can explain the local returns to value and momentum in U.S.\\nstocks almost as well as the U.S. factors can. These results suggest that global\\nvalue and momentum portfolios across markets and asset classes are closer to\\nthe efﬁcient frontier than U.S. stock-only value and momentum portfolios, and\\ntherefore provide a more robust set of asset pricing factors that can be used\\nmore broadly.\\nC.

The global models include a global CAPM (MSCI World index); a two-factor model of the global market\\nportfolio plus a factor-mimicking portfolio for a global liquidity risk factor (estimated from the cross-sectional regression coefﬁcients in Table IV); a\\nsix-factor model that includes the global market and factor-mimicking portfolios for global liquidity risk, GDP growth, long-run consumption growth\\n(each estimated from the cross-sectional regression coefﬁcients in TableIV), and TERM and DEF; the three-factor AMP model of the global market\\nplus all-asset-class value and momentum factors, as well as two-factor versions that include the market and just one of either all-asset-class valueor\\nmomentum. The U.S.-only factor models include the U.S. CAPM (U.S. CRSP value-weighted index), Fama and French three-factor model that adds\\nsize and value factors to the market, Fama–French four-factor model that adds a momentum factor, and Fama–French six-factor model that adds\\nTERM and DEF as additional factors.

TheEig% measure\\ncaptures how much of the covariance matrix of returns among the test assets\\neach model can explain.\\nAs the ﬁrst row of Panel A of TableVI shows, the market portfolio alone\\n(global CAPM) generates substantial pricing errors—an average absolute al-\\npha of 35 basis points per month that is easily rejected by the GRS test—and\\nleaves a lot of time-series and cross-sectional variation unexplained. The mar-\\nket portfolio captures about 57% of the covariation among the returns. The\\nsecond row adds the liquidity risk factor mimicking portfolio as a regressor,\\nand although the GRS test is still rejected, the average absolute alpha declines\\nto 31 basis points, the cross-sectionalR2 increases, and the amount of covaria-\\ntion captured increases. Hence, liquidity risk adds some additional explanatory\\npower for both pricing and common variation of value and momentum portfolios\\nglobally across asset classes.\\nWhile there is a link between value and momentum and liquidity risk, only\\na small fraction of the return premia and covariation is captured by our prox-\\nies for these risks. We view these ﬁndings as an important starting point for\\npossible theories related to value and momentum phenomena, but emphasize\\nthat we are far from a full explanation of these effects. We also recognize that\\nmeasurement error in liquidity risk may limit what we can explain. In addi-\\ntion, a single liquidity risk factor alone cannot explain value and momentum\\nsince they are negatively correlated with each other but both produce positive\\nreturns, unless there is substantial time variation in liquidity risk betas and\\nin the liquidity risk premium. Thus, it is not surprising that the pricing errors\\nfrom this model speciﬁcation remain large.\\nThe third row of TableVI, Panel A adds factor mimicking portfolio returns\\nfor GDP growth, long-run consumption growth, and TERM and DEF. Pricing er-\\nrors decline further whileR2s and the amount of covariation explained increase.\\nThe fourth row uses our three-factor model, which provides the best ﬁt.

Not surprisingly, the Fama–French U.S. factors do a good\\njob of capturing these returns, though the GRS test is still rejected. However,\\nthe global value and momentum everywhere factors, which consist primarily\\nof non-U.S. equities and other asset classes, also do a good job explaining the\\n50 U.S. equity-based test assets—the average absolute alpha is only 19 basis\\npoints, the cross-sectionalR2 is 68%, and the percentage of covariation captured\\nis 66%. This is better than the Fama–French three factor model does and only\\nslightly worse than the Fama–French four- or six-factor models, which are\\nspeciﬁcally designed to capture these portfolios and are constructed from the\\nsame set of securities as the test assets themselves.\\nFinally, Panel C of TableVI considers how well these factor models can ex-\\nplain hedge fund returns. Using the returns of 13 hedge fund indices from Dow\\nJones Credit Suisse (DJCS) and Hedge Fund Research Institute (HFRI) that\\ninclude from DJCS the Market Neutral, Long-Short, Multi Strategy, Macro,\\nManaged Futures, Currency, Emerging Markets, and Overall hedge fund in-\\ndices and from HFRI the Equity Hedge, Fund of Funds, Macro, Emerging Mar-\\nkets, and Overall hedge fund indices, Panel C of TableVI shows that the global\\nthree-factor model has smaller pricing errors than the Fama–French model\\nand its extensions with the momentum, TERM, and DEF factors. These results\\nare consistent with Boyson, Stahel, and Stulz (2010), Sadka (2012), and Bali,\\nBrown, and Caglayan (2011, 2012), who ﬁnd that the Fama and French U.S.\\nstock factors do not explain the cross section of hedge fund returns very well.\\nHowever, our simple value and momentum factors applied globally across asset\\nclasses do appear to capture a sizeable fraction of the returns to hedge funds.\\nThe evidence in TableVI suggests that the global across-asset three-factor\\nmodel does a good job of capturing not only the returns to value and momentum\\nglobally across asset classes, but also the returns to size and value and size and\\nmomentum in U.S. equities, as well as the cross section of hedge fund returns,\\nproviding additional testing grounds that are created from a completely differ-\\nent set of securities. Conversely, while local U.S. factors capture U.S. equity\\nreturns well, they do not explain a lot of value and momentum returns globally\\nor across asset classes, nor do they capture the returns to various hedge fund\\nstrategies well. While our three-factor global model performs better in explain-\\ning all of these different test assets, the GRS test still rejects our model in all\\ncases, suggesting that more work needs to be done to fully describe the cross\\nsection of returns.\\nV. Robustness and Implementation\\nFinally, we examine the robustness of our ﬁndings to implementation is-\\nsues.

Transaction Costs\\nLike most academic studies, we focus on gross returns, which are most suit-\\nable to illuminating the relation between risk and returns. However, gross\\nreturns overstate the proﬁts earned by pursuing the strategies we examine\\nin practice. A few papers try to examine the transaction costs and capacity of\\nthese strategies, especially momentum, perhaps due to its higher turnover. For\\nexample, Korajczyk and Sadka (2004) and Lesmond, Schill, and Zhou (2003)\\nargue that the real world returns and capacity of equity momentum strategies\\nare considerably lower than the theoretical results would imply. Their conclu-\\nsions are based on aggregate trade data and theoretical models of transactions\\ncosts. Using live trading data, Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2012) challenge\\nthese results and show that the real world trading costs of value, momentum,\\nand a combination of the two in equities are orders of magnitude lower for\\na large institution than those implied by the calibrated models of Korajczyk\\nand Sadka (2004) and Lesmond, Schill, and Zhou (2003). As a result, Frazz-\\nini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2012) conclude that these strategies can be scaled\\nconsiderably and still generate strong net returns. In addition, we focus on\\nan extremely large and liquid set of equities in each market (approximately\\nthe largest 17% of ﬁrms), where trading costs, price impact, and capacity con-\\nstraints are minimized.\\nStudies on trading costs also focus exclusively on individual stocks, but half\\nof the markets that we examine are implemented with futures contracts, which\\ntypically have much lower trading costs than stocks. Hence, although our equity\\nstrategies outperform our nonequity strategies in gross returns, net of trading\\ncost returns are likely to be much closer.\\nFurthermore, Garleanu and Pedersen (2012) model how portfolios can be\\noptimally rebalanced to mitigate transaction costs and demonstrate how this\\nimproves the net performance of commodity momentum strategies, for exam-\\nple. In a similar spirit, Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2012) demonstrate\\nhow equity portfolios can beneﬁt from several practical steps taken to reduce\\ntransactions costs that, while having a cost in terms of gross returns (from\\nstyle drift), can improve net returns. For instance, the strategies we study here\\nare all naively rebalanced exactly monthly no matter what the expected gain\\nper amount traded. Varying the rebalance frequency, optimizing the portfolios\\nfor expected trading costs, and extending or occasionally contracting the trade\\nhorizon can all improve the basic implementation of these strategies.\\nB. Shorting\\nOur paper is, of course, as much about shorting assets as it is about going\\nlong. While going long versus short is symmetric for futures, shorting involves\\nspecial costs in stock markets.

However, Israel\\nand Moskowitz (2012) provide evidence that the return contributions of both\\nvalue and momentum strategies across the same asset classes we study here\\nare roughly equal from the long and short sides of the portfolio and that long-\\nonly portfolios of value and momentum still produce abnormal returns. Thus,\\nthese strategies are still effective even if shorting is restricted. In addition,\\nFrazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz (2012) provide some evidence that the trading\\ncosts of shorting stocks are not materially different from the costs of buying\\nor selling stocks, and that real-world shorting costs for a large institutional\\ninvestor are not prohibitive to running sizeable funds in these strategies.\\nC. Portfolio Formation\\nIn this paper we intentionally keep everything as simple as possible, both\\nfor clarity and as a precaution against the pernicious effects of data mining.\\nIn fact, one of the paper’s objectives is to provide a robust out-of-sample test\\nof ideas that have been largely tested in individual, particularly U.S., stocks\\nand extend them to other asset classes. However, when faced with real world\\nimplementation, there are many choices to consider. For example, we look\\nat two simple portfolio implementations in the paper: top 1/3 minus bottom\\n1/3, and a linear weighting scheme based on ranking securities. These are far\\nfrom the only possibilities, and the choice of weighting scheme can impact not\\nonly gross returns, but also transactions costs. While we do not claim that\\neither of these choices is optimal in either a gross or net return sense, we also\\nexplore more extreme sorts of securities into deciles and ﬁnd that doing so does\\nnot materially affect the results. In the Internet Appendix we replicate our\\nmain results for individual equity markets in the United States, the United\\nKingdom, Europe, and Japan for decile portfolios and ﬁnd very similar results.\\nIn the Internet Appendix we also plot the pricing errors of our three-factor\\nmodel for these 80 decile portfolios of value and momentum in each of the four\\nequity markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan).\\nAs the accompanying ﬁgure shows and the asset pricing statistics verify, our\\nthree-factor model does a good job of capturing these more extreme portfolio\\nreturns, too.\\nWe also value weight stocks within our portfolios and equal weight the se-\\ncurities in other asset classes. However, other weighting schemes yield similar\\nresults and, because we focus on the largest, most liquid securities, trading\\ncosts are unlikely to be affected much by such changes. Hence, our main ﬁnd-\\nings are robust to a variety of perturbations and portfolio formations.\\nD. Volatility Scaling\\nWhen we aggregate our strategies across asset classes, we ensure that the\\ndifferent asset classes are scaled to have similar volatility. To do so, we scale\\neach asset class by the inverse of its realized volatility over the full sample.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='17484507-a7bd-4b15-8733-f6d62eb2db15', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '978', 'file_name': 'Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\HP\\\\Desktop\\\\RAG DEMO\\\\data\\\\Value and Momentum Everywhere.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 2101841, 'creation_date': '2024-11-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-08-28'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='978 The Journal of Finance R⃝\\nHowever, since the full sample is not known in advance, a real world portfolio\\nwould need to scale by a measure of volatility that is estimated ex ante. For\\nrobustness, in the Internet Appendix we report results for all of our value and\\nmomentum strategies scaled to the same ex ante volatility of 2% per annum\\nusing a rolling 3-year estimate of each portfolio’s volatility from daily returns.\\nThe results are reported together with the original unadjusted returns. The\\nSharpe ratios and correlations of the strategies are very similar and yield\\nidentical conclusions.\\nE. Dollar Neutral vs. Beta Neutral\\nAs is standard in academic studies, our strategies are constructed to be $1\\nlong and $1 short, but they need not have a zero market beta exposure (at the\\nlocal or global level). However, real world portfolios can, and often do, attempt\\nto create long-short portfolios that are ex ante beta neutral (in addition to,\\nor instead of, being dollar neutral). We ﬁnd that our inferences based on the\\nstrategies’ alpha from factor regressions are not affected by market hedging.\\nF. Value and Momentum Measures\\nWe use one measure for value and one for momentum for all eight markets\\nwe study. We choose the most studied or simplest measure in each case and\\nattempt to maintain uniformity across asset classes to minimize the potential\\nfor data mining. In real world implementations, data mining worries may be\\nweighed against the potential improvements from having multiple (and per-\\nhaps better) measures of value and momentum, if for no other reason than\\nto diversify away measurement error or noise across variables. Israel and\\nMoskowitz (2012) show, for instance, how other measures of value and mo-\\nmentum can improve the stability of returns to these styles in equities. Most\\npractical implementations use a variety of measures for a given style. In fact,\\nwe set out to examine value and momentum in eight different markets and as-\\nset classes using a single uniform measure for each. Although we ﬁnd positive\\nreturns to value and momentum in each asset class, these returns are not al-\\nways signiﬁcant. In particular, our weakest results using the current measures\\nof value and momentum pertain to bonds, which do not produce statistically\\nsigniﬁcant premia. However, as shown in TableI, Panel C, the returns can be\\nvastly improved using other measures of value and momentum, and taking a\\ncomposite average index of measures for value and momentum produces even\\nmore stable and reliable results. Hence, our use of simple, uniform value and\\nmomentum measures may understate the true returns to these strategies.\\nThe literature on realistic implementation of these strategies is still young,\\nand the list of choices to make when moving from an academic study like\\nours to implementing these strategies in practice is long. But current evidence,\\nresearch, and practical experience point to the effects we study being highly\\napplicable to real world portfolios.

Evolution over Time\\nAs the hedge fund industry has grown and more capital has been devoted to\\nthese strategies, it is interesting to consider what effect, if any, such activity has\\non the efﬁcacy of value and momentum strategies. While a complete analysis\\nof this question is beyond the scope of this paper, we offer a couple of results\\nperhaps worthy of future investigation.\\nTable VII reports the Sharpe ratios and correlations among the value and\\nmomentum strategies over the ﬁrst and second halves of the sample period—\\n1972 to 1991 and 1992 to 2011. As the ﬁrst row of Table VII, Panel A\\nshows, the Sharpe ratios to both value and momentum have declined slightly\\nover time. In addition, their correlations across markets have increased over\\ntime—the average correlation among value strategies has risen from 0.31 to\\n0.71 and among momentum strategies has risen from 0.46 to 0.77. However,\\nthe correlation between value and momentum has declined from –0.44 to –0.63,\\nand, as a result, the Sharpe ratio of the combination of value and momentum\\nhas not changed much over time, since the increased correlation across markets\\nis being offset by the more negative correlation between value and momentum.\\nThese results may be consistent with increased participation of arbitrageurs\\ndriving up correlations among value and momentum strategies globally.\\nThe next row of TableVII, Panel A repeats the same analysis, splitting the\\nsample prior to and after August 1998, which is roughly when the funding cri-\\nsis peaked following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM).\\nThe correlation among value strategies is much higher after August 1998 (0.16\\npre-1998 vs. 0.64 post-1998), and the correlation among momentum strategies\\nis also higher after 1998 (0.43 vs. 0.71). The next three rows of TableVII, Panel\\nA report the same statistics for periods of worsening and improving funding\\nliquidity, deﬁned as negative and positive funding liquidity shocks, and are\\nsplit separately into pre- and post-1998. Consistent with our previous regres-\\nsion results in TableIV, value strategies do worse when liquidity improves\\nand momentum strategies do worse when liquidity declines, but these patterns\\nappear only after 1998. Prior to the ﬁnancial crisis of 1998, funding liquidity\\nshocks seem to have little impact on value or momentum strategies. After 1998,\\nhowever, value generates a Sharpe ratio of 0.85 during periods of worsening\\nliquidity, but only 0.28 when liquidity improves. Conversely, momentum pro-\\nduces a Sharpe ratio of 0.19 when liquidity worsens, but a Sharpe ratio of 0.99\\nwhen liquidity improves. The 50/50 value/momentum combination is immune\\nto liquidity risk, even after 1998.\\nPanel B of TableVII examines more formally how value and momentum\\ncorrelations change over time and with liquidity shocks by running time-series\\nregressions in which the dependent variable is the cross product of monthly\\nreturns on the various strategies to proxy for time-varying correlations.

Liquidity shocks also appear\\nto signiﬁcantly increase correlations among momentum strategies, controlling\\nfor the time trend and recessions. However, the last three columns repeat the\\nregressions adding a post-1998 dummy variable and an interaction between the\\npost-1998 dummy and liquidity shocks. Rather than a time trend, the post-1998\\ndummy seems to be driving any correlation changes, and the impact of liquidity\\nshocks on correlations also appears to be exclusively a post-1998 phenomenon.\\nThese results are consistent with an increase in the importance of liquidity\\nrisk on the efﬁcacy of these strategies following the events of August 1998 that\\nappear to be more important than any time trend on the increasing popularity\\nof value and momentum strategies among leveraged arbitrageurs.20 Hence,\\nfunding liquidity risk and limits to arbitrage activity may be a progressively\\nmore crucial feature of these strategies and future work may consider these\\nissues in understanding the returns to value and momentum.\\nVI. Conclusion\\nWe provide comprehensive evidence on the return premia to value and mo-\\nmentum strategies globally across asset classes, and uncover strong common\\nfactor structure among their returns. The strong correlation structure among\\nvalue and momentum strategies across such diverse asset classes is difﬁcult to\\nreconcile under existing behavioral theories, while the high return premium\\nand Sharpe ratio of a global across-asset-class diversiﬁed value and momentum\\nportfolio presents an even more daunting hurdle for rational risk-based mod-\\nels to accommodate than the more traditional approach of considering value\\nor momentum separately in a single asset market. Although both behavioral\\nand rational theories for value and momentum focus predominantly on equi-\\nties, the existence of correlated value and momentum effects in other asset\\nclasses—with their different investors, institutional structures, and informa-\\ntion environments—argues for a more general framework.\\nWe further ﬁnd that exposure to funding liquidity risk provides a partial\\nexplanation for this correlation structure, especially following the funding crisis\\nof 1998, but leaves much to be explained. While the relation to funding liquidity\\n20 Israel and Moskowitz (2012) examine the relation between size, value, and momentum prof-\\nitability and aggregate trading costs and institutional investment over time.
